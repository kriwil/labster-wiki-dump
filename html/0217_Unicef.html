<p>Throughout the materials on this page, you will get the possibility to test out Labster's Crime Scene Investigation learning game (also known as the CSI-case). However, to give a short idea what Labster's CSI-case is all about, please take a quick view at the below video, before you scroll down in this document.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Background_information_related_to_the_CSI_case">Background information related to the CSI case</span></h2>
<p>Labster developed this CSI case in collaboration with The Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The users of this case are entry level undergraduate students studying biotechnology with most of them having some biotechnology background knowledge. 
</p><p>In the CSI case, students need to utilize their scientific knowledge in DNA profiling in order to run PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and gel electrophoresis and solve the case. By using Labster, students learn how to work in a laboratory environment as well as learning how science can be applied in real life situation. 
</p><p>Students start by reading the background theory and then continuing to the virtual laboratory. They are also presented with quiz questions throughout the laboratory. If they do not know the answer, students can always click on the "view theory" button and go back to the Wiki page discussing the related theory. The case ends once students have completed the laboratory exercises, answered all the quiz questions and convict the murderer.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Time_for_you_to_solve_the_CSI-case.21">Time for you to solve the CSI-case!</span></h2>
<p>We have specially prepared some tools for you to be able to go through our CSI case even if you do not have any biotechnology background. We suggest you to go through the case in similar way to the students. However we have extra materials for you if you get stuck.
</p><p><b>1. Read the theory in the Wiki pages</b>
</p><p>Before starting the CSI case, we recommend to read the related theory. This will provide you with sufficient knowledge to complete the case.
