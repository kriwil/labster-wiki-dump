<p><i>Physcomitrella</i> is a member of the bryophytes that has been used increasingly as a model organism. The mosses are non-vascular plants with a main haploid phase. Bryophytes include various mosses and liverworts that grow in moist and shaded areas. The genome of <i>P. patens</i> was sequenced in 2006 and now serves as model organism for plant evolution, physiology, development and genomic studies. <i>P. patens</i> can be maintained in large continuous protonema cultures with a stable genetic background. Mechanical forces continuously splitting the tissue into smaller pieces can maintain the protonemal stage . In addition, <i>P. patens</i> has proven to be very tolerant towards a number of abiotic stresses; it can also grow in a minimal medium, containing only minerals and water.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Homologous_recombination">Homologous recombination</span></h3>
<p><i>Physcomitrella patens</i> is the only known land plant that can be efficiently transformed by homologous recombination. Homologous recombination allows for the insertion of a DNA fragment into a certain gnomic location. This is achieved by flanking the transgene with two DNA sequences that are homologous to a certain genomic locus. When the cognate sequences bind, the endogenous DNA repair complex integrates the DNA fragment into the moss genome. Thereby, inserting a marker gene into an exon can result in efficiently knocking out specific genes. There are also reports of chimeric proteins being produced by inserting an alternative coding sequence into a gene. <i>P. patens</i> transgene integration into the cognate sequence occurs at frequencies of up to 100% in flowering plants, however only a fraction of the biological replicas are transformed correctly by homologous recombination.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Vector_construction">Vector construction</span></h3>
<p>Transformation vectors contain the same basic elements as expression vectors. The transgene, cloned from another organism, is the main component of the vector. A vector can contain several transgenes but the longer the construct gets, the lower the efficiency for transformation. Gene expression depends on the promoter sequence upstream from the transgene. The CaMV 35S promoter is commonly used for plant transformations. It is a very strong, constitutive promoter from the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), hence the gene downstream is highly expressed in all tissues. To stop transcription, a terminator sequence is cloned to the end of the transgene. Another essential component of the transformation vector is a marker gene, which allows us to select the transformed cells. Often antibiotic resistance genes are used for efficient selection of transformed cells on growth media containing antibiotics. If an organism is transformed with several constructs, each vector needs to encode for a different selectable marker gene, otherwise cells that were transformed with only one vector cannot be differentiated from those with both constructs. For homologous recombination, the entire vector needs to be flanked with homology regions; this means that the homology regions are complementary to either a sequence within a gene that needs to be knocked out or an  intragenic region of the host genome.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="PEG-Mediated_Transformation">PEG-Mediated Transformation</span></h3>
<p>Naturally cells avoid the uptake of foreign DNA such as viruses, therefore we need to overcome the cells protection shields. An enzyme cocktail that degrades the long polysaccharides, which make up the cell walls, can remove and breakdown the cell walls. The resulting naked cells are called protoplasts. Like mammalian cells they are enclosed by the plasma membrane. Polyethylene- glycol (PEG) is an organic polymer, which binds to DNA and makes the membrane permeable for the complex. Thereby, the vector can infiltrate the cells. The protoplasts are mixed with the DNA and PEG; then the DNA can enter the nucleus and a fraction of the cells are transformed by the construct. W5 solution is added to remove the PEG after the incubation. The W5 solution contains CaCl2, glucose, KCL , MES and NaCl which all retain PEG in the solution. Therefore, the PEG can be easily separated out from the protoplasts by centrifugation.
</p><p>The cells must be grown on selective media in order to choose only the successfully transformed cells with the resistance marker. This is because cell transformation only occurs at low frequencies.

<p>Metabolic engineering in microorganisms is limited because P450's are not functionally expressed often in yeast or bacteria. <i>Physcomitrella</i> protonema cultures are the ideal solution because they can be grown in fermenters like microorganisms but also, the moss cells offer the right environment for the complex proteins necessary in the production of secondary metabolites. Thus, we can preserve rare plant species by using transgenic plants, i.e. the secondary metabolites can be produced in large quantities without extracting the components from rare plants.
