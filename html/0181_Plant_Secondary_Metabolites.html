<p>In addition to primary metabolites, which are essential for plant growth, plants also produce various secondary metabolites, which are important for the plants&#8217; adjustment to its environment. Primary metabolites include amino acids, nucleotides, sugars and lipids. Secondary metabolites are very diverse and are often unique to a few closely related species. Depending on the precursor derived from the primary metabolism, secondary metabolites are divided into three groups: 
<br/>
&#8226;	Terpenes and Terpenoids<br/>
&#8226;	Phenolic and polyphenolic compounds<br/>
&#8226;	Nitrogen/sulphur containing compounds <br/>
</p><p>Secondary metabolites fulfill many different functions such as protection from herbivores, microbial pathogens, or attractants for pollinators. Humans use many secondary metabolites as industrial materials, flavors, coloring, poisons and medicinal drugs.   <br/>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Terpenes_and_Terpenoids">Terpenes and Terpenoids</span></h3>
<p>Terpenoids, or isoprenoids, are the largest group of natural compounds in living organisms. Terpenoids contain functional groups that are attached to a highly non-polar terpene backbone. Therefore, terpenoids are mostly insoluble in water. Many terpenoids are biologically active and protect the plant from parasites. Hence, they are promising candidates for novel pharmaceuticals. Plant terpenoids often have a strong scent and are extensively used for aromatic purposes. Well-known terpenoids include menthol, cannabinoids, citral, and the curcuminoids found in turmeric and mustard seeds. Terpenoids contribute to the scent of eucalyptus, the flavors of cinnamon, cloves and ginger, and the yellow color in sunflowers and the red color in tomatoes. 
</p><p>Artemisinin, produced by <i>Artemisia annua</i>, is a sesquiterpenoid antimalarial therapeutic. When a malaria parasite invades a red blood cell and digests the hemoglobin it causes oxidative stress. This initiates a chemical reaction of arthemisinin. The resulting molecule becomes highly reactive and perturbs the redox homeostasis in the parasite. The precise mechanism of action, however, is still uncertain.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Phenolics">Phenolics</span></h3>
<p>Phenolic compounds contain a phenol group. One of the largest classes of phenolic compounds are the flavonoids. The yellow pigmentation of citrus fruits, for example, is derived from flavonoids. They are also abundant in berries, dark chocolate and red wine. Flavonoids have important anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and anti-cancer capabilities due to its powerful antioxidant properties.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Nitrogen-Containing_Compounds">Nitrogen-Containing Compounds</span></h3>
<p>Nitrogen-containing compounds are diverse plant secondary metabolites that contain nitrogen in their structure. This class includes alkaloids and cyanogenic glycosides which are famous for their toxicity and medicinal properties. Alkaloids act as defense molecules against herbivores, especially mammals, while cyanogenic glycosides are known for their ability to release volatile poisonous hydrogen cyanide (HCN).
