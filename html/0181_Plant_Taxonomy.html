<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plant_Taxonomy">Plant Taxonomy</span></h3>
<p>Common names are easier to remember but are often not precise enough for science. For example, a common name can refer to various plant species or one plant species can have various common names. This is why scientific names in Latin are useful and important to distinguish between species. The Latin names consist of the capitalized genus name followed by the species name. <br/><br/>
The plant kingdom or Plantae is a domain of the eukaryotes. Plant taxa were traditionally classified according to the phenotypic traits. The emergence of DNA sequencing technologies have allowed several taxa to be relocated within the phylogenetic tree. <br/><br/>
Land plants are subdivided into two groups: vascular and non-vascular plants. The Bryophyta (mosses) is a familiar division of non-vascular plants. Vascular plants comprise several divisions including Pteridophyta (ferns), Magnoliphyta (flowering plants) and Pinophyta (conifers). Traditionally seeded plants are subdivided into Gymnosperms and Angiosperms. The latter is the most diverse group of land plants and encompasses all flowering plants.

<ul><li> Gymnospermae (gymnos: naked, sperma: seeds) are plants with exposed ovules before and after fertilization. The largest group of Gymnosperms are the Pinophyta, which include pine, fir and redwood. <br/>
</li><li> Angiospermae (from the Greek word for &#8220;vessel seed&#8221;): The major characteristic of Angiosperms is the flower, which acts as the reproductive organ of the plant. Angiospermae seeds are enclosed by the fruit. The angiospermeae is a very diverse group; it encompasses the tiny duckweed as well as the mighty banyan trees. Almost all of the economically important crops belong to this group. <br/>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plant_Speciation">Plant Speciation</span></h3>
<p>Speciation is the evolutionary process by which new biological species arise. A species is a group of individuals whose members have the potential to produce a fertile offspring with a member of the same species but not with members of other species.
