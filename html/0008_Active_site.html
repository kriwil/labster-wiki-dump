<p>The area where substrates and co-factors binds to the enzyme is called the active site. This is where the catalysis takes place. An active site often appears like a pocket, and consists of several amino acids which can have specific interactions with the substrate [1]. Fig. 1 shows the active site of <a href="/index.php/ADH" title="ADH">alcohol dehydrogenase</a> where NAD<sup>+</sup> binds. Amino acid residue 47, which is responsible for the Asian glow syndrome is located in this active site, and this amino acid is important in binding to NAD<sup>+</sup>. If a mutation causes an amino acid substitution on this residue, the kinetic parameters may therefore be altered, which is the case in the Asian glow syndrome.
