As you can read on the previous section <a href="/index.php/DNA_NGS" title="DNA NGS">DNA</a> can be extracted from any cell. Ancient DNA refers to DNA that was extracted from ancient specimens, such as skeletal materials, mummified tissues, or other specimens that have not been preserved specifically for further DNA analysis. Ancient DNA undergoes degradation due to temperature exposure, water exposure and other factors. The older the DNA sample is, the more damage it undergoes. But due to recent advances in DNA analysis technology, even ancient DNA can be analyzed using Next Generation Sequencing.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ancient_DNA_characteristics">Ancient DNA characteristics</span></h3>
<p>Ancient DNA shares some characteristics that are caused by the damages they undergo. By identifying these characteristics, we can recognize the ancient DNA sample from modern contaminating DNA (for example, the DNA sample of an individual who did not handle the sample properly before being analyzed in the laboratory). Below are some of the ancient DNA characteristics that are normally used in Next Generation Sequencing analysis.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Cross-linking</b> <br/>
</li></ul>
<p>Cross-linking can occur between bases on the same DNA strand, also called as interstrand cross-links or between DNA and other molecules, also called intermolecular cross-links. In intermolecular cross-links, DNA can be cross-linked to another DNA strands or to a protein. Cross-links may prevent the amplification of endogenous template molecules, but it could also stabilize the DNA molecule over time, and hence reduce the fragmentation. <br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Hydrolytic damages</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>Hydrolytic damages are responsible for damages in the sugar backbone; it could result in single strand breaks or loss of DNA bases. When purines (Adenine or Guanine) are lost, the event is referred to as <i>de-purination</i>. Hydrolysis could also result in a conversion of base from Cytosine to Uracil by releasing ammonia in the process. This even is referred to as <i>de-amination</i>. De-amination could also occur in other bases (Cytosine, Adenine, or Guanine). <br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Oxidative damages</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>Oxidative damages are caused by the direct interaction of ionizing radiation with the DNA, as well as mediated by free radicals created from water molecules by ionizing radiations resulting in modified bases. Some oxidative damage results in lesions blocking the polymerase enzyme, and promoting chimeric sequences through "jumping PCR". <br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Fragmentation</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>As described above, ancient DNA undergo many damages, including strand breaks and de-purination that leads to short-size molecules. Because the DNA strands are already fragmented, we do not need to expose the DNA sample for further fragmentation in the Next Generation Sequencing sample preparation step. According to recent studies, the average length of ancient DNA fragments can vary from 50-150 bp. <br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Base substitution pattern</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>There are common base substitution patterns that are observed in ancient DNA samples. Base substitutions of <i>C &gt; T</i> and <i>G &gt; A</i> are observed higher in ancient DNA sample than what is found normally in modern DNA samples. However, these substitutions are not equally distributed along the DNA molecules. The <i>C &gt; T</i> substitutions are found most commonly a the 5' end of the DNA molecule whereas the <i>G &gt; A</i> substitutions are found most commonly a the 3' end of the DNA molecule.
