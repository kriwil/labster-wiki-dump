<p>DNA polymerase is the enzyme that is responsible for the formation of a DNA strand from a template DNA strand. For the DNA polymerase to initiate the formation of a new DNA strand, it needs a short "starter" strand, called a <a href="/index.php/Primers" title="Primers">Primer</a>. The primer must be bound to an area of the template DNA to which it is complementary.

<p>DNA polymerase can add nucleotides to the 3' end of a primer bound to the template DNA because this end has a free hydroxyl group (-OH) that can react with the phosphate group of the incoming nucleotide. Therefore, the new DNA strand is said to be synthesized in the 5'&#8594;3' direction. The new DNA strand will be complementary to the template strand, and antiparallel.

<p>DNA polymerase originates from living organisms and is most functional at physiological conditions. Hence, the DNA polymerase from most organisms would not work well in a PCR reaction because most polymerases degrade at 90<sup>o</sup>C. If such a polymerase was to be used for PCR, it would be necessary to add new DNA polymerase after each cycle. Luckily, a suitable DNA polymerase was discovered by Thomas Brock: the Taq polymerase. This DNA polymerase was isolated from the bacterium <i>Thermus aquaticus</i> found in the hot springs at Yellowstone National Park. The Taq polymerase is active at temperatures up to 95<sup>o</sup>C. This ensures that multiple cycles of PCR can be performed in a single continuous event, and no additional polymerase is required.
