<p>When conducting an experiment with a large number of similar samples, it is common to prepare a master mix to ease the workload in the lab. If all your samples have a similar mixture of reagents with only 1 reagent varying from sample to sample, a master mix can be prepared with all the common reagents (of course, this is only possible if all reagents are required in the same concentrations). Now, when setting up your samples, you can pipette from the master mix and then add your variable reagent, instead of mixing e.g., 4 different reagents in correct amounts into each and every tube. The concept is illustrated in the 2 figures to the right.
</p><p><br/>
In this enzyme kinetics case, at a specific substrate concentration, a master mix, containing NAD<sup>+</sup>, ethanol and buffer, can be prepared. When the enzyme is added, the reaction starts, and the enzyme is therefore not included in the master mix. This is not a case where it is crucial to use a master mix; however, the skill is essential for many applications, and it is very useful in enzyme kinetics assays in general.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Calculating_substrate_concentrations">Calculating substrate concentrations</span></h2>
<p>In the experiment, you will need to calculate how much substrate to add to a tube to obtain a desired substrate concentration. This can be done using the following formula: 
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="C1_.E2.80.A2_V1_.3D_C2_.E2.80.A2_V2"> C<sub>1</sub> &#8226; V<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>2</sub> &#8226; V<sub>2</sub> </span></h4>
<p>where C = concentration and V = volume. Remember to use the same units on both sides of the equality sign! 
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Example</b>: We have a stock solution of the substrate at 1 M, and we need a final concentration of 200 mM in a volume of 500 &#181;l; what is the volume of stock solution that we need to add for achieving the desired concentration? 
</li></ul>
<p><br/>
If the stock concentration is C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub> will be the desired final concentration and V<sub>2</sub> will be the final volume. This makes V<sub>1</sub> the unknown element. We can now isolate V<sub>1</sub>, insert the known values and calculate the volume:
</p><p><br/>
Isolate:
V<sub>1</sub> = (C<sub>2</sub> &#8226; V<sub>2</sub>)/C<sub>1</sub>
</p><p><br/>
Insert and calculate:
V<sub>1</sub> = (0.2 M &#8226; 0.0005l) / 1 M = 0.0001 L = 100 &#181;l
