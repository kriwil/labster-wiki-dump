<p>Temperature is an important factor when separating compounds using HPLC. The column can be placed inside a closed oven where the temperature can be regulated.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Thermodynamics_in_HPLC"> Thermodynamics in HPLC </span></h2>
<p>The retention of a solute in a chromatographic system is determined firstly, by the magnitude of the distribution coefficient of the solute between the two phases and secondly, by the amount of stationary phase available to the solute for interaction. The important point is that the equilibrium constant is a thermodynamic quantity. Therefore, the following relation from thermodynamics applies:
</p><p><a href="/index.php/File:DeltaG.png" class="image"><img alt="DeltaG.png" src="/images/DeltaG.png" width="215" height="38"/></a>
</p><p>Where &#8710;G is the standard free energy of adsorption to the stationary phase, &#8710;H is the standard enthalpy of adsorption to the stationary phase, &#8710;S is the standard entropy of adsorption to the stationary phase and T is the temperature in the system.

</p><p>Where K is the equilibrium constant for the distribution between the mobile and stationary phase, R is the the gas constant and ln the natural logarithm, and <i>k'</i> is the capacity factor. As seen by the equation above, the Gibbs free energy (&#8710;G) can be correlated to capacity factor (k'). By expanding the Gibbs free energy equation, we can measure the effect of temperature change to the capacity factor.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Benefits_of_running_in_higher_temperature">Benefits of running in higher temperature</span></h2>
<p>There are several benefits of running the compounds separation in higher temperature. Besides decreasing the run times, an increase in temperature can have other beneficial effects. As the temperature increases, the viscosity of the mobile phase will decrease, resulting in lower pressures. Lower mobile-phase viscosity also improves diffusion in the chromatographic system, giving narrower peaks. Simultaneously, shorter retention times will generate narrower peaks. Narrower peaks mean taller peaks, assuming the same mass of sample on the column, and thus lower detection limits. And if you are happy to work at the original pressure, you can further reduce the run time by increasing the flow rate with isocratic separations until the original pressure is reached. 
</p><p><br/>
Increasing the temperature also increases the compound solubility. When a compound has a low solubility, they may precipitate and clog the column. This can be avoided by increasing the temperature. However one must also take into consideration that compound stability depends on the temperature, especially biological compounds. When the temperature is too high, these compounds may degrade and you will not be able to get a good separation and measurement. 
</p><p><br/>
So in many cases, an increase in temperature can have multiple benefits &#8211; if adverse selectivity changes are not encountered.
