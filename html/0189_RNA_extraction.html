<p>In order to retrieve the RNA molecules from plant cells, the cell walls must be cracked and plasma membranes lysed. Every organism encodes for RNAses, an enzyme family that degrades RNA molecules. It is important to be very careful when working with RNA because of the abundance of RNAses in the environment. Any grain of dust can contain RNAses, which can degrade the RNAs in your sample. Therefore, the cells are usually ground in liquid nitrogen with a temperature of -196&#176;C. Liquid nitrogen boils at -196&#176;C; at this low temperature the enzymes are inactivated and all biological functions stop. In addition, the low temperatures render the cell walls brittle which makes them very fragile and breakable.  <br/>
A common method used to isolate total RNA is guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction. This method utilizes a chemical called TRI reagent. The TRI reagent maintains the RNAs integrity, disrupts cells and denatures proteins.  <br/> 
</p><p>The main steps of RNA isolation are as follows:<br/>
</p>
<ul><li>Cell lysis and disruption of cellular structures.<br/>
</li><li>Separate RNA from cell debris.<br/>
</li><li>RNA is purified.<br/>
</li></ul>
<p><br/>Once the macromolecules are in a solution they can be separated from the cell debris by centrifugation. Phase separation of the sample will occur when chloroform is added to the monophasic TRI reagent. The polar RNA will remain in the upper polar phase, DNA will accumulate in the interphase and the denatured proteins will dissolve in the lower organic phase. The RNA is recovered by adding isopropanol, which precipitates polar molecules like RNAs and salts. The salts can be washed away with 75% ethanol to obtain pure RNA.
