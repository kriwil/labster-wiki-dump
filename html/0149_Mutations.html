</p><p><br/>
Mutations are categorized according to how they change the order of bases:
</p><p>Substitution: one base is replaced by another
</p><p>Deletion: one or more bases are deleted
</p><p>Insertions: one or more bases are inserted
</p><p>(Chapter 7 page 200)
</p><p><br/>
Mutations in coding sequences are categorized according to their effect on the protein:
</p><p>Synonymous/silent mutation: a substitution that does not change the amino acid
</p><p>Non-synonymous/missense mutation: a substitution that changes the amino acid
</p><p>Nonsense mutation: generates a stop codon
</p><p>Frameshift mutation: insertion or deletion not divisible by 3 that alters the reading frame
</p><p>(Chapter 8 page 276)
