<html><head></head><body><div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>Array Comparative Genome Hybridization (aCGH) compares the patient&#8217;s genome against the reference genome and identifies difference between the two genomes. These differences are recognizes as genomic imbalance (for example a deletion/loss or a duplication/gain) in the patient. Array CGH capable of giving quantitative result. <br/> 
</p><p><br/>
In the array-CGH we expect to detect a high number of small DNA segments that are present in more or less than two copies. Some of these are Copy Number Variation (CNV), and most of these probably have no phenotypic effect. CNV is a DNA segment (minimum 1000 base pairs) that is present in varying number of copies in different individuals, and in rare cases associated with disease. <br/> 
</p><p><br/>
<b>Advantage</b><br/>
</p>
<ul><li>Analysis of whole genome in single experiment 
</li><li>Higher resolution than conventional CGH
</li></ul>
<p><b>Limitation</b><br/>
</p>
<ul><li>Inability to detect mosaicism, balanced chromosomal translocation, inversion and whole-genome ploidy changes.
</li></ul>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Sample">Sample</span></h2>
<p>Prenatal samples such as amniotic fluid obtained by amniocentesis are at risk of contamination by maternal cells. Presence of maternal cells in amniotic fluid may have impact in the identification of fetal abnormalities by aCGH. Maternal cell contamination (MCC) poses a significant prenatal misdiagnosis such as false positive or false negative. <br/>
</p><p><br/>
Pure DNA can be extracted from fetal cells in amniotic fluid sample. Typical DNA extraction is performed using a column with silica-gel membrane where DNA will bind specifically. All contaminant will be wash and pass through the silica-gel membrane.
</p><p><br/>
DNA sample extracted from fetus cell or blood must undergo washing and fragmentation prior the labeling step. DNA sample need to be clean from salt, wash buffer and divalent cation which can disturb the labeling efficiency. DNA sample fragmentation are done by incubating it at 95<sup>o</sup>C.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Procedure">Procedure</span></h2>
<p>The Array CGH steps are described as follow:<br/>
</p>
<ul><li>The sample and reference DNA are labeled with different colored fluorescent probes. The sample DNA is labeled with Cy3, a green fluorescent dye, while the reference DNA is labeled with Cy5, a red fluorescent dye. 
</li><li>Both samples are hybridized to array which contain probe sequence of all chromosome. Three fluorescent colors can be observed after microarray hybridization. Yellow indicate a normal or no change in the sequence. Red indicate a deletion while green indicate a duplication. 
</li><li>A microarray scanner will pick up the fluorescence signal and plot it into a graph. 
</li></ul>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Cy3_and_Cy5">Cy3 and Cy5</span></h2>
<p>Cy3 and Cy5 dyes are sensitive to light and should be stored and used in the dark as much as possible. Therefore it is highly recommended to perform all labeling steps in the dark to prevent signal loss from dye photo-bleaching.

<p>The Cy3 and Cy5 molecule interact with DNA using universal linkage system (ULS) which uses a special platinum compound. The platinum compound has two free binding sites. The first binding site binds to a marker group which is the cyanine compound (Cy3 and Cy5) forming a Cy ULS complex. The second binding site link the complex to the purine of single stranded, double stranded, linear or supercoiled DNA, RNA or chromosome.
