<html><head></head><body><div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>A pedigree is a diagram depicting members of a family, their inter-relatedness and their disease/phenotypic status. A pedigree is made to give an overview of the inheritance pattern and frequency of a (suspected) hereditary trait.
Each family member is represented by a symbol: circle (female) or square (male), which is filled/black for affected individuals and empty/white for normal individuals. Matings are illustrated by a connecting horizontal mating line, their offspring is depicted beneath a vertical offspring line, and sips are attached to a horizontal sip ship line. Each generation is assigned a roman numeral (I, II, III, and others) and each individual of a generation is assigned an arabic numeral (1, 2, 3, and others).
