Normally, they are dissolved in the same solvent as the mobile phase. Once the sample is ready, there are two different ways of introducing it in the system: manual and automated injection.

<p>When using a manual injection, you can only inject 1 sample at a time. A syringe is used to inject the sample into the HPLC machine, as seen in Figure 1.
</p><p><br/>
Manual injection consists of a rotary valve (also called Rheodyne injector, see Figure 2) with two main positions: "Load" and "Inject". When the valve is in the "Load position", the sample can be introduced in the system with a syringe. The liquid will fill up a loop which contains a fixed constant volume. The excess of sample that was introduced in the system is discarded in a bottle for waste. Then, you can switch the valve to the "Inject position" and the sample contained in the loop will finally be injected into the mobile phase. The main disadvantage of this type of injection is that it is time consuming since you have to inject the samples one by one.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Automated_injection">Automated injection</span></h2>
<div class="thumb tleft"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:367px;"><a href="/index.php/File:AutoSampler.png" class="image"><img alt="" src="/images/AutoSampler.png" width="365" height="249" class="thumbimage"/></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><b>Figure 3.</b> This is an automated sampler, where a robot will inject the samples into the HPLC machine.</div></div></div>

<p>In contrast to the manual injection, a robot is used to inject the sample into the machine. The efficiency is much improved as compared to the manual injection because you can inject many more sample in a short time. Because of this the automated injected is used more in the lab.
</p><p><br/>
It consists of an auto sampler (see Figure 3) where you place all your samples in different numbered positions. They can be placed in vials (see Figure 4) or plates with several wells. The only thing that rests is programming with a software the sequence of injections. A robotic needle will move to the chosen position, take the desired volume and transfer it into a loop from where it is injected into the mobile phase.
