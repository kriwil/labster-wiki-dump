<p>The main components of the HPLC are listed below:

<ul><li> <b><a href="/index.php/Mobile_phase_reservoir" title="Mobile phase reservoir">Mobile phase reservoir</a></b> &#8594; This is where the mobile phase is contained. The mobile phase is normally stored in glass bottles.
</li><li> <b><a href="/index.php/Pumps" title="Pumps">Pumps</a></b> &#8594; The function of the pump is to create high pressure and create a flow of mobile phase in the system.
</li><li> <b><a href="/index.php/Sample_injector" title="Sample injector">Sample injector</a></b> &#8594; This is where the sample in introduced in the system. The sample needs to be in liquid form (solution).
</li><li> <b><a href="/index.php/Column" title="Column">Column</a></b> &#8594; This is where the sample separation takes place. The column is filled with beads that is referred to as stationary phase.
</li><li> <b><a href="/index.php/Oven_regulator" title="Oven regulator">Oven regulator</a></b> &#8594; This is where the column is kept and the temperature can be controlled.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Starting_the_HPLC_Machine"> Starting the HPLC Machine </span></h2>
<p>There are several steps that you need to do before you can run your HPLC experiment. The major steps are outlined below:
</p>
<ul><li>  <b>Sample preparation:</b> <br/>
</li></ul>
<p>Only liquid samples can be introduced in the HPLC system. Therefore, sample pre-treatment is required to clean-up interferences and/or dissolve the analytes in a solvent. Three techniques are typically used to remove interferences are extraction, filtration and centrifugation.
</p><p>When the sample is solid, we need to process the sample from solid into homogeneous solution. We can start by crushing the sample to make powder by using a mortar and pestle. Then we can dissolve the powdered sample into a solution. To eliminate clumps of sample that is not properly dissolved, we can run the solution through a fine filter (typically a 0.5&#956;m filter). Now we can be sure that our sample is a homogeneous solution and ready to be injected into the HPLC machine. <br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Conditioning the system:</b> <br/>
</li></ul>
<p>It is important to condition the column performing any analysis. This is done by turning on the pump and selecting flow rate and temperature. Then, you only need to wait until the pressure in the system is constant. This means that the mobile phase has reached every pore of the column, activating its beads, and the system is ready for the injection of the sample. It will take some time for the mobile phase to activate all the beads, in this time the flow rate and pressure is unstable. 
</p><p>It is very important to have exactly the same condition when you are running several experiments and would like to compare them. This is why conditioning the system is an important step. You will need to repeat this step when you are measuring using another mobile or stationary phase. When you are changing the mobile phase, you also need to flush the tubing (connecting the mobile phase reservoir to the column) and make sure that there is no remaining old mobile phase left. <br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Calibration curve:</b> <br/>
</li></ul>
<div class="thumb tleft"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:501px;"><a href="/index.php/File:CalibrationCurve.png" class="image"><img alt="" src="/images/thumb/CalibrationCurve.png/499px-CalibrationCurve.png" width="499" height="300" class="thumbimage"/></a>  <div class="thumbcaption">Calibration curve showing the sample concentrations in x axis and the area under the curve in y axis.</div></div></div>
<p>In order to be able to determine the concentration of the analytes in the sample, a calibration curve is needed. This is done by measuring several solutions with known concentrations and inject them into the system. You can then compare the known concentration with the resulting chromatogram, the peak area also known as area under the curve is proportional to the sample's concentration. The larger the area is, the higher the concentration is. You can also observe the <i>retention time</i> or the specific time it takes for the sample to travel through the column and recorded at the detector. This <i>retention time</i> is compound specific. When you are running a sample mixture that contains several different compounds, you can then identify the compounds based on their <i>retention time</i>. 
</p><p><br/>
The calibration curve is prepared by measuring several concentrations creating a linear line. These concentrations have include concentration that is both lower and higher than the expected concentration of the analyte in the real sample. When you do not know the analyte concentration in the real sample, typically you will prepare a calibration curve using minimum 8 different sample concentrations. When you know the expected analyte concentration in the real sample, you can reduce the number of sample concentrations needed for the calibration curve.
