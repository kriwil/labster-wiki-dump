<p>Terpenoids can be extracted from plant material by solvent extraction; an organic solvent such as chloroform should be used due to the non-polar nature of terpenoids. The dissolved molecules can be purified further with simple techniques such as liquid-liquid partitioning with a polar solvent such as water. The dissolved molecules can then be separated by Liquid Chromatography (LC) using a silica gel column. Thus, polar molecules interact with the silica beads, which leads to a prolonged retention time. Apolar molecules, similar to terpenoids, move faster through the column. By optimizing solvent strength, mobile phase composition, pH, gradient and temperature the different molecules elute at different retention times and can be separated.

<p>Each purified component can then be characterized by mass spectrometry (MS). The mass spectrometer accelerates the molecules and ionizes them to produce charged molecular fragments. The accelerated ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio by a strong magnetic field in the mass spectrometer. Each molecule breaks into different fragments depending on the chemical structure of the molecule. Therefore, each component produces a mass spectrum with a unique fragmentation pattern. This molecular fingerprint can be compared to a database and the component can be identified.
