</p><p>In the Next Generation Sequencing case, you will sequence the DNA of an ancient Greenland man. You will learn about the different steps required from having a purified DNA sample into the Next Generation Sequencing data. You will also analyze the sequencing data and do a SNP analysis where you can determine the physical characteristics of the ancient Greenlandic man.
</p><p>You will be able to find all the related theory required to complete the case from this Wiki page.
</p><p>Good luck!
