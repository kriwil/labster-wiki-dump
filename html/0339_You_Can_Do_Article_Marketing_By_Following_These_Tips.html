But now, with the advent of movies like "Jurassic Park," you have decided to write articles for popular magazines as well. This calls for a sharp pivot in your approach. Your use of language must change. Read on for this and other tips.
</p><p>Put words like "How to" and "Why" in your title. They make the reader curious about your subject matter and draw them into your piece. Using top ten and top five lists also work well to generate interest in the article. It is ideal if you can combine one of these phrases with a keyword to produce your heading.
</p><p>To produce higher quality articles, set out to become an expert on a particular subject. Having a really deep understanding of what you are writing about will make your articles stand out. If you become recognized as an authority on a subject, people will naturally want to seek out your articles.
</p><p>Deal with article-writing burnout by finding inspiration. Writing articles day in and day out becomes very tough for some people -- after a while you feel like you have used up all the words you had left in you. Get inspired to write new articles by checking what others are writing in your niche, going to eZinearticles and reading on other random topics, or doing searches in Yahoo! answers to see what people really want to know about your topic.
</p><p>Make sure that every article you provide is full of useful, interesting information. Remember that search engine bots may read for keywords, but people read for interest and entertainment or because they are trying to find something out! Your articles should have fresh, timely information about subjects people are interested in.
</p><p>Your article's title is perhaps the most important part of the entire text in marketing. This is not to say that you shouldn't focus equally on the body of the text, but your title is going to be the first thing people read. If the title isn't catchy enough to draw them in, people are never going to read the article in the first place.
</p><p>Be sure to fill the resource box of your article with rich details. It is important that you put your links in this box and entice them to want to learn about what you are writing about. Without this information, you are not going to grab onto the reader's attention.
</p><p>Article directories are out there waiting and ready to be taken advantage of. The first thing you should do is submit your articles to the most popular online article directories. These directories are very helpful, they already have the clientele you need, and they are looking for your articles.
</p><p>Now you are ready to write those articles for the general reader, who will be younger and less informed than your scholarly readers. You have taken note of the kind of language used in the magazine to which you are going to submit your article--language that will interest the reader but not overwhelm them with specialized terminology.
