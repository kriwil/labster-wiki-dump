The outcome of the detector is processed by the computer and the typical outcome is a chromatogram representing the signal strength vs. the retention time. The signal strength measures the amount of analyte that is detected by the detector. By comparing this signal strength to a calibration curve, we can know the exact concentration of the analyte. The retention time is the time that the analyte needs from the time of sample injection to travel through the column and then passing the detector.

The light travels from the source passing through a slit and dispersed into various wavelength using dispersion device (a prism). The light then passes another slit called the exit slit. This slit acts as a selector only allowing a certain wavelength to pass and go through the sample. The amount of light that successfully went through the sample is then quantified by the detector.</div></div></div>
<ul><li> <b>UV-Vis Detector</b>: The signal (also called response) corresponds to the absorbance of structure absorbing UV light of a specific compound or group of compounds. The higher the concentration, the higher the absorbance.
</li><li> <b>Photodiode Array (PDA) Detector</b>: PDA is used in combination with UV and creates a wavelength scan for each compound. By using PDA it is possible to monitor several wavelengths at the same time.
</li><li> <b>Fluorescence Detector</b>: The signal corresponds to the fluorescence of compounds. Sample with higher concentration will emit stronger signal. Fluorescence detector is the most sensitive among modern HPLC detector. 
</li><li> <b>Mass Spectroscopic (MS) Detector</b>: MS works by creating an ions from sample molecules. These ions will provide information about the molecular weight of the compound. These ions can be generate by fragmentation of the compounds due to an applied electric field. The higher the concentration, the higher the amount of fragments and the higher the signal.

<ul><li> <b>Refractive Index Detector</b>: Based on changes in the refractive index when light passes through the eluted compounds.
</li><li> <b>Electrochemical Detector</b>: Based on electrochemical oxidation or reduction of the analytes on the surface of an electrode.
</li><li> <b>Light Scattering Detectors</b>: The response is based on the light scattered by the molecules from a laser source and is proportional to the mass of the analytes.

</p><p>UV spectroscopy is the most widely used detector for liquid chromatography. Most compounds can be detected by UV with good sensitivity (typically to 1-10ng range). However not all compounds can be detected by a UV-vis detector. For example saturated hydrocarbons and sugars lacking double bonds are very difficult to detect using UV detector, such as: methane, butane, pentane, hexane, octane etc. These molecules have sigma bonds (&#963;) that is very stable and require a lot of energy to excite them. This is why they are difficult to detect using UV detector.
