They recognize a  specific site of double-stranded DNA and cleave it within or adjacent to their recognition site. The optimal activity of each restriction enzyme is affected by conditions such temperature, pH, enzyme cofactor, salt composition, and ionic strength.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Reaction_conditions">Reaction conditions</span></h2>
<p>Incubation temperature affects the activity of restriction enzyme greatly. In general, the incubation time reflects the growth temperature of the bacterial strain from which it originates. Most of the restriction enzymes have an optimum temperature of 37&#176;C and an optimum pH of pH 7.2 or pH 8.5. These physical environment requirements must be met to ensure that the enzyme reaches its maximum activity. Outside the desirable physical condition range, the enzyme can denature. Enzymes work very specifically; therefore, they will not work properly if their structure deteriorates. Because each restriction enzyme is isolated from different bacteria and have different optimum reaction condition, they require specific buffer that is used for each restriction reaction.

<p>Restriction enzymes can be divided into 4 groups based on their recognition sequence, subunit composition, cleavage position, and cofactor requirements. The essential difference between them are summarized in Table 1.

</th>

<p>The most useful type of restriction enzymes that have been sold commercially is type II restriction enzyme. Because it consists of two different enzymes, it is possible to cleave DNA without modification. Moreover, the type II restriction enzyme activity does not require a cofactor such as ATP or <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine.

<p>Most type II restriction enzymes recognize and cleave DNA within a specific sequence of 2-8 nucleotides, which is palindromic. A palindromic sequence means that the nucleotide base sequence reads the same backwards (3' to 5' direction) and forwards (5' to 3' direction). Type II restriction enzymes produce three different ends: 
</p><p>a) <b>Blunt-end</b> <br/>
This type of enzyme cuts precisely at the same site in both DNA strands generating blunt end DNA fragments without overhangs.<br/>
b) <b>5' sticky end</b> <br/>
This type of enzyme cuts asymmetrically within the recognition site such that a short single-stranded segment extends from the 5' ends.<br/>
c) <b>3' sticky end</b> <br/>
This type of enzyme cuts asymmetrically within the recognition site such that a short single-stranded segment extends from the 3'<br/> ends.
