The word chromosome derived from the Greek words <i>chromos</i>, meaning color, and <i>soma</i>, meaning body.  Chromosomes are the structure that holds the genes. Gene defined as the entire nucleic acid sequence that is necessary for the synthesis of a functional gene product (polypeptide or RNA).<br/>

<p>Each chromosome is paired with its homologous chromosome which have an exact match in size and structure. The autosome are numbered 1 to 22 according to size. The X and Y chromosome are placed at the end.

<p>Chromosome morphology and staining characteristic are obtain from the most visible chromosome, the metaphase chromosome. During interphase, when cells are not dividing, the genetic material exists as a nucleoprotein complex called chromatin, which is dispersed through the nucleus.<br/>

Each metaphase chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, which are attached at the centromere.Telomere refers to specialized DNA sequences located at the end chromosomes. Centromere divides chromosome into a short arm (p; petit) and a long arm (q;queque). The short and long arm can be connected in either metacentric, submetacentric, acrocentric or telocentric. <br/>
</p>
<ul><li>Metacentric: The centromere position is at the middle, so the length of the arms is almost equal
</li><li>Submetacentric: The arm leght is unequal
</li><li>Acrocentric: The short arm is extremely short so is hard to observe. The human genome has six acrocentric chromosome which include: 13, 14, 15, 21, 22 and Y.
</li><li>Telocentric: The centromere position is at the end of chromosome. Human does not posses this type of chromosome. 
</li></ul>
<p>Human have 23 pairs of chromosomes which organized into 22 pairs of homologous autosomes and two sex chromosomes (X and Y). A chromosome banding pattern is comprised of alternating light and dark stripes, or bands, that appear along its length after being stained with a dye. A unique banding pattern is used to identify each chromosome.

<p>Karyotype is abbreviated by the total number of chromosomes, a comma, and the sex chromosomes of an individual. Each arm of chromosome (p and q) is further subdivided into regions by landmark. Landmarks is consistent and distinct morphologic area of a chromosome. Regions are divided into bands which further divided to sub-bands. Example: Xp22.3 = X chromosome, short arm region 2, band 2, sub-band 3.
