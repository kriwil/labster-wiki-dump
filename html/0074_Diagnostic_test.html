A DNA test is usually expected to be used for testing many DNA samples and it should therefore be cheap, reliable and fast. PCR in combination with gel electrophoresis are frequently used as a DNA test. If the mutation is an insertion or a deletion, the mutated DNA region is amplified using PCR. The length of the product can then be visualized by gel electrophoresis revealing a shorter or longer product as compared to the wild type.
