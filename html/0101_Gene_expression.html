<html><head></head><body><div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>When a gene is expressed, it is first transcribed (DNA &#8594; mRNA) and the mRNA is then translated into a protein. Not all genes in the genome are expressed in all cells/tissues because the need and function of various cells/tissues differ. Therefore, the consequences of a gene mutation will primarily affect tissues relying on and expressing that specific gene.
Techniques for detecting gene expression are for example, northern blot, quantitative PCR, and microarray.
