A <i>spectrophotometer</i> is an instrument that permits the determination of the ratio between the intensity of the light emitted from a lamp in the spectrophotometer, and the light that passes through a given solution. This ratio can be used to determine the concentration of the molecules in the solution. The spectrophotometer is set only to measure at a certain wavelength; this wavelength can be adjusted so that the optimal wavelength for measuring the specific compound is used. The spectrophotometer displays the so-called absorbance (A), which is calculated as-log(I<sub>t</sub>/I<sub>0</sub>), where I<sub>0</sub> is the intensity of the incident light and I<sub>t</sub> is the intensity of the light that passes through the solution and is actually measured by the spectrophotometer. There is a linear relationship between absorbance and concentration, this relationship is described by the Lambert-Beer Law as follows: 
</p><p><b>A = log (I<sub>0</sub> / I<sub>t</sub>) = &#949; &#8226; <i>c</i> &#8226; <i>l</i> </b>
</p><p>where <i>c</i> is the concentration of the solution, <i>l</i> is the length of the solution (through which the light has to pass) and &#949; is the <i>extinction coefficient</i>, which is specific for a compound. [1]
</p><p><br/>
A spectrophotometer consists of the following (Fig. 1): 
</p>
<ul><li> a light source
</li></ul>
<ul><li> a wavelength selector
</li></ul>
<ul><li> a sample container (e.g., a cuvette)
</li></ul>
<ul><li> radiation transducers 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> a detector   
</li></ul>

<p>In this case, we will measure concentrations of NADH. NADH has an absorption maximum at 340 nm; therefore, the spectrophotometer is set to measure at this wavelength. The extinction coefficient for NADH, &#949; = 6220 M<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup>. The length of the solution is usually set to 1 cm.

There are certain limitations of the Beer-Lambert's Law that the investigator needs to take into consideration. Some of these are related to technical issues; however, the law does have a real limitation; because it only applies to dilute solutions. When the concentration of an absorbing species increases, so does the physicochemical interactions among the molecules. Thus, at a given concentration, the molecules will begin to affect the charge distribution of the neighbor molecules; when this occurs, the relationship between absorbance and concentration is no longer linear. As a rule of thumb, one should stay below an absorption value of 1 when doing measurements. 
</p><p><br/>
Notably, absorbance is inversely proportional to what is known as <i>transmittance</i> (see a textbook for details); an absorbance value of 1, 10% of the light is transmitted through the sample, at 2, 1% of the light is transmitted and so on in a logarithmic trend.
