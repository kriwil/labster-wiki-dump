<p>Fragmented DNA (either artificially fragmented or partially degraded) typically have sticky ends, implying that 1 of the strand is longer than the other strand (see Figure 1) DNA with sticky ends will ligate easily to other DNA that has complementary sticky ends. To prevent DNA with these sticky ends to pair with another DNA, we need to modify them into DNA with blunt ends (see Figure 1). One of the steps in the NGS sample preparation is to repair these sticky ends and create DNA with blunt ends. This is important for the next step, <a href="/index.php/A-tailing" title="A-tailing">A-tailing</a>.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="End-repair_enzymes">End-repair enzymes</span></h2>
<p>Two enzymes are typically used for repairing DNA with sticky ends (see Figure 2)
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Polymerase</b>: Polymerase fills in the missing bases for the strand from 5' to 3' direction. The resulting double strand DNA will be the same length as the original longest DNA strand. 
</li><li> <b>Exonuclease</b>: Exonuclease removes the 3' overhangs. The resulting double strand DNA will be the same length as the original shortest DNA strand.
</li></ul>
