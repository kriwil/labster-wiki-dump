<p>In the black box model, the input and output of the system  are analyzed instead of the processes inside the system itself. All the chemical reactions that occur within the cells are neglected, and the whole fermentation process is viewed as one single reaction, where substrates are converted to biomass and products. <br/>

In general, only the most important substrates and products are regarded. For example, for yeast cells, the general stoichiometric equation would be as follows: <br/>
<a href="/index.php/File:GenStoichiometric_equation.jpg" class="image"><img alt="GenStoichiometric equation.jpg" src="/images/thumb/GenStoichiometric_equation.jpg/700px-GenStoichiometric_equation.jpg" width="700" height="20"/></a><br/>
The coefficient in front of every compound is the yield coefficients. That is the ratio between the change in compound j and the change compound i. <br/>
<a href="/index.php/File:Yield.jpg" class="image"><img alt="Yield.jpg" src="/images/thumb/Yield.jpg/150px-Yield.jpg" width="150" height="46"/></a><br/>
In exponential growth, there is a linear relationship between substrate consumption and product formation. The yield coefficient will thereby be constant, which can be calculated as the slope in a plot of the product versus substrate. <br/>

</p><p><b>Carbon balance and cmol</b><br/>
For carbon balance (or any elemental balance in the fermentation for that matter), the general stoichiometric equation is used. All the compounds that contain carbon are taken into account: <br/>
<a href="/index.php/File:Massbalance.jpg" class="image"><img alt="Massbalance.jpg" src="/images/thumb/Massbalance.jpg/500px-Massbalance.jpg" width="500" height="23"/></a><br/>
Because only the elemental contribution of biomass and not the specific molecular formula is known, the units are changed to cmol. Relative to cmol, the general composition in the microorganism is CH<sub>1.8</sub>O<sub>0.5</sub>N<sub>0.2</sub>. When converting to cmol, the molecule and the molecular weight are normalized to the carbon content. For example, glucose(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) having the molecular weight of 180 g/mol in cmol is CH<sub>2</sub>O, and it has the molecular weight of 30 g/cmol (simply the original molecular weight divided by the number of carbon atoms). The yields coeffcients can be converted from g/g to cmol/cmol.<br/>
<a href="/index.php/File:ConvertCmol.jpg" class="image"><img alt="ConvertCmol.jpg" src="/images/thumb/ConvertCmol.jpg/350px-ConvertCmol.jpg" width="350" height="54"/></a><br/>
After converting the units to cmol, the carbon balance is as follows: <br/>
<a href="/index.php/File:CarbonBalance.jpg" class="image"><img alt="CarbonBalance.jpg" src="/images/thumb/CarbonBalance.jpg/700px-CarbonBalance.jpg" width="700" height="23"/></a><br/>
The carbon balance is a good method of controlling the fermented microorganisms. If the carbon balance does not close, there is a lot of unaccounted carbon, which means unknown byproducts are being produced. 
</p><p><br/>
<b>Molecular weights</b><br/>
The following elemental molecular weights are usefull when calculating the molecular weights of the organic substances:<br/> 
Mw (Hydrogen) = 1 g/mol <br/>
Mw (Carbon) = 12 g/mol <br/>
Mw (Nitrogen) = 14 g/mol <br/>
Mw (Oxygen) = 16 g/mol<br/>
</p><p><br/>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Productivity"> Productivity </span></h3>
<p>The simplest term for productivity is the volumetric productivity, called q, and it is the amount of product formed per time per volume. <br/>
<a href="/index.php/File:Vol_product.jpg" class="image"><img alt="Vol product.jpg" src="/images/thumb/Vol_product.jpg/180px-Vol_product.jpg" width="180" height="47"/></a><br/>
If one wants to compare the production rate of two different microorganisms, one would have to consider that the growth rate of the two organisms could be different. The specific productivity, called r, is the amount of product formed per time per g DW. It can be calculated as follows: <br/>
<a href="/index.php/File:Spe_product.jpg" class="image"><img alt="Spe product.jpg" src="/images/thumb/Spe_product.jpg/150px-Spe_product.jpg" width="150" height="44"/></a><br/>
The specific productivity is both dependent on the yield (how much product is produced in relation to biomass) and how fast the cells are growing(how much biomass is generated) It is related to the volumetric productivity with the concentration of biomass. <br/>
<a href="/index.php/File:Qp%3Drp.jpg" class="image"><img alt="Qp=rp.jpg" src="/images/thumb/Qp%3Drp.jpg/90px-Qp%3Drp.jpg" width="90" height="35"/></a><br/>
The volumetric production is dependent of the biomass concentration. In batch fermentation the biomass concentration is growing, and so the productivity is not constant. If one want to make an estimate over the overall volumetric productivity it is calculated as the maximum product concentration, divided by the time to reach that concentration. 
</p><p>Often, there is a tradeoff in productivity and yield. Better yield makes the process cheaper (less substrate is needed to form same amount of product), but higher productivity means faster production and thereby smaller production facilities. As a rule of thumb, yield is most important for low-value products (e.g., bulk chemicals) and productivity is most important for high-value products (e.g., pharmaceuticals)
