This co-factor binds the enzyme and contributes to the reaction, and leaves the enzyme with the product in a changed state. This could, for example, be a changed oxidation state, as is the case for NAD<sup>+</sup>, which then needs to be restored elsewhere before the co-factor can assist in another reaction.</div></div></div>
<p>Some enzymes require "helper-molecules" for catalysis to take place. These helper-molecules are called cofactors. Cofactors are non-protein molecules that bind to the enzyme and contribute to reactions in a number of different ways. Co-factors can either be inorganic ions, such as the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions required by <a href="/index.php/ADH" title="ADH">ADH</a>, or they can be more complex organic or metalloorganic molecules, which are then called co-enzymes. If a co-factor is bound tightly (sometimes covalently) to the enzyme, it is termed a prosthetic group [1].

<p>The enzyme ADH from this case requires the co-enzyme Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) in order to function. This co-enzyme takes up a hydride ion (H<sup>-</sup>) from the ethanol, leading to the formation of an acetaldehyde. NAD<sup>+</sup> is reduced to NADH and thereby works as an electron acceptor. Most co-enzymes are derived from vitamins, and NAD<sup>+</sup> is derived from the vitamin niacin. Without NAD<sup>+</sup>, ADH would not function. The chemical structure of NAD<sup>+</sup> and the manner in which reduction takes place is shown in Fig. 1 [1].
