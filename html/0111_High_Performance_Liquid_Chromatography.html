HPLC is a very powerful technique that can be used to identify, quantify or purify components of a mixture. HPLC is different from the traditional liquid chromatography because it utilizes a significantly higher operational pressure (50-350 bar), while the ordinary liquid chromatography typically uses the gravity force to pass the mobile phase through the stationary phase.

<p>As it is shown in Figure 1, this method uses a column which is filled with fine beads that form the <b>stationary phase</b> and a solvent, which is known as <b>mobile phase</b> and, as the name suggests, moves over the column due to pressure that is generated by the pump.

</p><p>When a mixture of analytes (<span style="color:#ff0000">A</span>, <span style="color:#008000">B</span> and <span style="color:#0000ff">C</span>) pass through the column, they will interact differently with the stationary phase based on their property. Analytes that interact the least with the stationary phase will move the fastest <span style="color:#ff0000">(A)</span>. In contrast, analytes that interact the most with the stationary phase  will stay longer in the column <span style="color:#0000ff">(C)</span>) and reach the detector last.

In chromatography, compounds that alike attract each others. Polar compounds will be most attracted to other polar compounds and non polar compounds will be most attracted to other polar compounds.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Two_different_techniques:_normal-_and_reverse-phase_HPLC">Two different techniques: normal- and reverse-phase HPLC</span></h2>
<p>Based on the polarity of the mobile phase and stationary phase, HPLC can be classified into "normal-phase" or "reverse-phase". In "normal-phase HPLC" the stationary phase is polar and the mobile phase is non polar. When the polarity is reversed, the technique is then called "reverse-phase HPLC" where the stationary phase is non polar and the mobile phase is polar. 
</p><p><br/>
"Reverse-phase" HPLC is the most common HPLC method. When using "reverse-phase" non-polar compounds <span style="color:#0000ff">(C)</span> interact the most with the stationary phase and are retained more in the column and elute last, while the polar compounds <span style="color:#ff0000">(A)</span> interact the most with the mobile phase and elute first.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Applications_of_HPLC">Applications of HPLC</span></h2>
<p>HPLC is a widely used tool for analysis of all kind of samples. This technique is so powerful because in the appropriate conditions, complex mixtures of several compounds can be separated. Thus, it can useful for example in the food industry, forensic samples and also in pharmacy to separate and identify the active compounds and excipients present in drugs.
