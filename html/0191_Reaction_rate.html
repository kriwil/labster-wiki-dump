The parameters <i>V<sub>max</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> can be obtained experimentally for any given enzyme; however, they themselves provide very little information about the reaction mechanism, such as the number of discrete steps and their individual reaction rates. The reaction rate (V) is defined as the change in concentration over time. The rate can be expressed as either the rate of formation of products (P), or as the rate of consumption of reactants (the substrate, S) [1].

</p><p>Note that the rate of consumption of the substrate is equal to the negative change in the concentration of the substrate over time. 
The Michaelis-Menten equation described on the previous page is based on the following reaction mechanism:
</p><p><a href="/index.php/File:Fig1.jpg" class="image"><img alt="Fig1.jpg" src="/images/thumb/Fig1.jpg/400px-Fig1.jpg" width="400" height="98"/></a>
</p><p>This mechanism includes 3 individual reactions with three different rate constants:
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<ul><li>	E + S &#8594; ES, formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, with the rate constant k<sub>1</sub>
</li></ul>
<p><br/>
</p>
<ul><li>	ES &#8594; E + S, dissociation of the enzyme and the substrate, with the rate constant k<sub>-1</sub>
</li></ul>
<p><br/>
</p>
<ul><li>	ES &#8594; E + P, dissociation of the enzyme and the product, with the rate constant k<sub>2</sub>
</li></ul>
<p><br/>
In the Michaelis-Menten model it is assumed that the third reaction is the rate-limiting step, and the associated rate constant k<sub>2</sub> is also called the <a href="/index.php/Kcat" title="Kcat">turnover number</a> or k<sub>cat</sub>. For another reaction mechanism, the turnover number would be defined differently, for instance, in the following reaction:

</p><p>where the last step is the rate-limiting step. Here, k<sub>cat</sub> is equal to the rate constant of this step, i.e., k<sub>cat</sub> = k<sub>3</sub>. For reactions with more complicated reaction mechanisms, k<sub>cat</sub> can be a function of several rate constants. [2]

<p>During the course of the reaction, [S] decreases and [P] increases. This results in an overall decrease in the reaction rate, as illustrated in Fig. 1. To measure the reaction rate of an enzymatic reaction corresponding to a specific substrate concentration, it is therefore necessary to measure the reaction rate in the beginning of the reaction. In the beginning of the reaction, the substrate concentration can be assumed to be constant, and the progress curve is close to linear. Thus, the rate of the reaction, which is equal to the slope of the progress curve, can be obtained using linear regression. The reaction rate in the beginning of the reaction is called the initial reaction rate or V<sub>0</sub> [1].
