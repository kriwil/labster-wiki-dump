You can perform linkage analysis using two traits (like in early fruit fly experiments) or you can perform linkage analysis between DNA markers (e.g., STR markers) and a locus involved in an inherited disease. Today, linkage analysis is typically performed to identify a candidate region and thereby focus the search for a candidate gene to a limited chromosomal region.
