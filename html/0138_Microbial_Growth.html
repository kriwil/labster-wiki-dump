Generation time refers to the time taken for one cell to become two, both in terms of total cell number and mass.  Each microorganism's generation time is determined by growth medium and incubation conditions used.

<p>Batch culture is a closed-culture system which contains an initial, limited amount of a nutrient. In batch culture, microbial growth can be classified into four phases: the lag phase, log/exponential phase, stationary phase, and death phase. In some species, such as <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the exponential phase can occur twice with slightly different growth rates due to a switch in metabolic pathways.   <br/>

<p>Cells grow at a constant and maximum rate, which can be described by this equation:<br/>

Note that the change in biomass is dependent on the concentration of biomass. Integration of the formula gives the following: <br/>

As seen, from the equation, &#956;<sub>max</sub> can be found in a plot of ln(x) versus time. The intercept of this plot will be ln(x<sub>0</sub>), and the slope will be &#956;<sub>max</sub>, also called the maximum specific growth rate. <br/>
</p><p>Doubling time of cells is the time it takes for the biomass concentration to double. It can be calculated using formula below: <br/>
<a href="/index.php/File:Double_equation.jpg" class="image"><img alt="Double equation.jpg" src="/images/thumb/Double_equation.jpg/200px-Double_equation.jpg" width="200" height="93"/></a><br/>

Yeast cells shows diauxic growth when grown aerobic on glucose. Diauxic means that there is two growth phases, separated by diauxic shift. Diauxic shift is a period of transition from glucose to ethanol as the substrate for growth and reproduction.  During the initial exponential phase, yeasts utilize glucose as the carbon source, but when glucose becomes scarce, yeasts switch to the fermentation product, ethanol, as the carbon source. Yeasts continue to use ethanol until ethanol has been depleted and finally enter the stationary phase.
