<html><head></head><body><div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p>Typical prenatal test available for expecting parents are as follows: <br/>
</p><p><b>Prenatal Screening Test</b><br/>
Identify baby's possible increased risk of having a particular problem. Screening test cannot tell if the baby definitely has a problem but may indicate that further testing needs to be considered.<br/>
Prenatal screening test includes nuchal (perform during gestational week 11 to 14), ultrasound examination (perform during gestational week 18 to 20) and maternal serum testing.<br/>
</p><p><br/>
<b>Prenatal Diagnosis Test</b><br/>
Identify baby's problem/abnormality, for example by using DNA analysis or karyotyping. Even though the prenatal diagnosis is normal, the baby could suffer from other problem. At this point, we don&#8217;t know enough to rule out any kind of chromosomal changes. We need to look at all chromosomes.<br/>
Prenatal diagnosis test includes ultrasound examination, chorionic villus sampling (CVS), amniocentesis, and cordocentesis.
</p><p><br/>
In Denmark, the choice and risk of the prenatal diagnosis test must be explained clearly to the patient to allow the patient to consider the best option for her. Increase emphasis on quality assurance and control of professional services, including information is very important.

<p>Ultrasound is the use of high frequency sound waves to make an image.  Ultrasound is part of prenatal diagnostic test that are used to see if the baby actually has a particular problem. An ultrasound scan can be conducted at any time during pregnancy. But different timing when the ultrasound is performed serves a different purpose. The optimal time for dating the pregnancy and determine the number of babies is between 8 and 12 weeks. The best time for baby physical development assessment to check any abnormalities is between 18 and 20 weeks.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Chorionic_Villus_Sampling_.28CVS.29">Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)</span></h2>
<p>Only women at high risk are offered CVS.Chorion is one of the membrane that exist during pregnancy. The chorionic tissue has small projection on its surface called villi (singular: villus) in order to give a maximum blood. The cells of chorion are mostly the same as the cells of the baby, because both cells are arise from the same fertilized cells.
</p><p><br/>
Basically, there is two type of CVS: abdominal and vaginal CVS. In abdominal CVS, the chorion sample is obtained using a fine needle through the abdominal wall. In vaginal CVS, a speculum is inserted into vagina to achieve clear view of the cervix. Then a fine tube is inserted into uterus through the cervix to take a small sample of the chorion. Both abdominal and vaginal CVS are performed with guidance of ultrasound.

<p>Amniotic fluid obtained via amniocentesis provides a source of fetal material used in prenatal diagnosis. Amniocentesis usually performed during 15 to 18 weeks of gestation. The reason is that 15 to 18 weeks of gestation is consider late enough to cause no harm to the fetus development and early enough to allow termination of pregnancy. Other than that, optimal amount of fetal cell needed for further chromosomal analysis can be obtain during that time of gestation. The fetus starts to shed cells into the amniotic fluid at 11 weeks of gestation.
Ultrasound is performed before and during the amniocentesis to guide the needle. The very thin needle is put into uterus through the abdomen.
</p><p><br/>
Even though amniocentesis is considered safe and has been performed multiple times, there is about 1% risk of abortion and it is not offered to every pregnancy. Generally, amniocentesis is offered to couples thought to be at increased risk of chromosomal abnormality or inherited genetic disorder. 
<br/>
</p><p><br/>
Up to 20 mL of amniotic fluid is obtained from typical amniocentesis procedure. The fluid consists of cellular component and supernatant component which can be separated using centrifuge. The cellular component is further analyses using biochemical, DNA testing and chromosomal testing method. The supernatant component can be used for certain biochemical studies mostly for determination of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level as a screen for neural tube defect.
