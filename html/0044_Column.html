<p><br/>
The column is a fundamental part of the HPLC system since it is where the separation of the analytes takes place. The column is packed with small beads made of silica that can be coated. It is the surface material covering the beads that determine the polarity. Silica beads are polar in their nature, but when coated with long carbon chains, they become non polar. Because the beads inside the column are stationary during the run, they are also referred to as the stationary phase.
</p><p><br/>
In reverse phase, the stationary phase packed in the column is non polar. Therefore, non polar analytes will interact with the column and stay longer there, leaving the column later than polar compounds.

<p>The beads in columns are normally based on silica or a polymer. Different chains can be attached to the structure, giving different types of interactions:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Interactions based on polarity:</b> polar compounds will be retained by stationary phases with polar chains, such as &#8211;CN or &#8211;OH. Non polar compounds will be retained by non polar groups in the stationary phase, such as &#8211;C8 or &#8211;C18.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Ionic interactions:</b> depending on the pH, some groups can be protonated or deprotonated, forming ionic species. If the analyte and the stationary phase have opposite charges, the analytes will be retained in the column.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Molecular size:</b> Small molecules can be retained in the pores of the stationary phase whereas large molecules will not get trapped. Therefore, small molecules will stay longer in the column whereas large molecules will pass faster.
</li></ul>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Separation_techniques">Separation techniques</span></h2>
<p>Depending on the type of interactions present between analytes and stationary phase, we can find two main HPLC techniques:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Reverse Phase HPLC:</b> based on non polar interactions. Non polar compounds will move slower in the column than polar compounds.
</li><li> <b>Normal Phase HPLC:</b> based on polar interactions. Polar compounds will move slower than non polar in the column.
</li></ul>
<p><br/>
Two other techniques are Ion Exchange Chromatography (based on ionic interactions between analytes and resins positively or negatively charged) and Size Exclusion Chromatography (based on the molecular size of analytes). 
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Polarity_scale">Polarity scale</span></h2>
<p>The polarity of a molecule can be compared to another molecule's polarity. One molecule can be more polar when compered to another molecule, but it can also be less polar when compared to a different molecule. One can say that polarity has its own scale. For example, CN is more polar than C8 but less polar than Silica.
