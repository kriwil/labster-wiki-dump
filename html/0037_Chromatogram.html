<p>The chromatogram (see Figure 1) is the representation of the signal strength acquired by the detector vs. time. Before the analyte reaches the detector, we get some signal which is only noise and is called baseline. When the analyte reaches the detector, this signal starts increasing until a maximum and then decrease until all the analyte has been detected. This maximum corresponds to the peak height. The time from the injection until this peak maximum is called retention time (t<sub>R</sub>)
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Peak"> Peak </span></h2>
<p>Apart from the retention time and the peak height, another part of the peak is the width, which is measured as it is shown in the Figure. Sometimes it is interesting to measure the half of the peak (Height/2) and how broad the peak is at that point (w<sub>1/2</sub>) 
These numbers are useful to calculate the so called &#8220;number of plates&#8221; (N), which is a value that gives an idea of how efficient a column is. The higher the number, the more efficient the column. That is, columns that lead to narrower and sharper peaks.

</p><p>In addition, when two peaks appear in the chromatogram, these parameters help to calculate the resolution (R), which gives an idea of how good the separation of the two analytes is. It should normally be higher than 1.5 for good quantification.

</p><p><br/>
There are several instances where a separation is not successfully reached and the resulting is a merged peak instead of several distinctive peaks corresponding to each compounds. As we have discussed earlier, separation is defined by the interaction of analyte to the mobile and stationary phase. When both of the mobile and stationary phase has the same polarity, no separation can be achieved. This will result in a chromatogram showing a merged peak.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Concentration"> Concentration </span></h2>
<p>If you count from the baseline, you can see that the curve contains a defined area under it. The peak area is used to make the calibration. This is done because that area is proportional to the concentration of the analyte. The higher the concentration, the larger the peak and, thus, the higher the peak area. 
</p><p><br/>
Once you have plotted the points using the peak areas of the known concentrations, you can make linear regression analysis (y = mx + y<sub>0</sub>) to find out the equation that relates the peak area and the concentration of the analyte. The peak area is plotted on the y axis and the analyte concentration is plotted on the x axis. y<sub>0</sub> is the point where the line intersects the y axis, which is constant. When you apply a linear regression analysis, you will be able to determine the slope (m) of the line. Thus, you can use the peak area that was processed for your unknown sample and calculate the concentration of the analyte, as shown in the Figure 2.
