Lineweaver-Burk plots showing the three major types of inhibition. If the y-intersect differ, but the slopes are the same, the inhibitor is competitive; if the slopes differ, but the y-intersects do not, the inhibitor is uncompetitive; and if both the slope and the y-intersects differ, the inhibitor is mixed.</div></div></div>
<p>An uncompetitive inhibitor interacts with the enzyme-substrate complex, but not with the enzyme alone. For un-competitive inhibition, the double-reciprocal equation is as follows:
</p><p><a href="/index.php/File:Double_reciprocal_un-competitive_inhibition_equation.png" class="image"><img alt="Double reciprocal un-competitive inhibition equation.png" src="/images/thumb/Double_reciprocal_un-competitive_inhibition_equation.png/265px-Double_reciprocal_un-competitive_inhibition_equation.png" width="265" height="80"/></a> where <a href="/index.php/File:Inhibition_alpha%27.png" class="image"><img alt="Inhibition alpha'.png" src="/images/thumb/Inhibition_alpha%27.png/158px-Inhibition_alpha%27.png" width="158" height="80"/></a>
</p><p>This equation shows that a double-reciprocal plot of enzyme kinetic data with varying concentrations of an un-competitive inhibitor should give a straight line with varying y-intercepts, but with the same slopes (Fig. 2). In enzyme kinetic assays with an uncompetitive inhibitor, the apparent K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> will change with increasing inhibitor concentrations [1].

<p>When working with an un-competitive inhibitor, no parameters can be calculated from the initial Lineweaver-Burk plots. To calculate the different parameters, the &#8216;&#8217;y-intersects&#8217;&#8217; of these plots must be plotted against the inhibitor concentration. Thus, based on the above mentioned equations:
</p><p><a href="/index.php/File:Y-intersect_uncompetitive.png" class="image"><img alt="Y-intersect uncompetitive.png" src="/images/thumb/Y-intersect_uncompetitive.png/563px-Y-intersect_uncompetitive.png" width="563" height="80"/></a>
</p><p>This plot should therefore result in a straight line with the intercept 1/<sub>max</sub> and slope 1 / (V<sub>max</sub> &#8226; K<sub>I</sub> ). K<sub>I</sub> can therefore be calculated by dividing the slope of this straight line with the intercept. V<sub>max</sub> can also be calculated from this fit, by taking the reciprocal to the y-intercept. 
Because the initial Lineweaver-Burk plots had the same slopes, K<sub>m</sub> / V<sub>max</sub>, K<sub>m</sub> can now be calculated by multiplying these slopes with V<sub>max</sub> obtained from the plot of y-intercepts against inhibitor concentrations.

<ul><li> Prepare Lineweaver-Burk plots of the kinetic data and fit the data using linear regression (1 fit per inhibitor concentration).
</li><li> Plot the y-intersects of each of these fits as a function of the inhibitor concentration.
</li><li> To calculate V<sub>max</sub>, take the reciprocal of the y-intersect of this plot.
</li><li> To calculate K<sub>I</sub>, divide the y-intersect of this plot with the slope. 
</li><li> To calculate K<sub>m</sub>, go back to the first Lineweaver-Burk plots, take the slope from 1 of these plots (the slope should be the same, or close, for all the plots), and multiply it with V<sub>max</sub>.
