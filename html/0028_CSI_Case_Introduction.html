<p>In Crime movies and CSI TV-series, science and biotechnology are shown as essential parts of solving a murder. But how does this really work? How is evidence processed in real life laboratories, and how are experimental data used to convict a murderer?
</p><p>Often at crime scenes, evidence containing human biological material is collected. This could be blood, hair, or semen. If such a sample has been collected, it is crucial to determine whether it is from the victim or someone else; if the sample is not from the victim, it is most probably from the individual person who committed the crime. But how is it determined who the sample comes from?
</p><p>In the Labster CSI case, it is your mission to use DNA profiling to try and to solve a brutal murder of a Professor!
</p><p>But first, learn how to perform DNA fingerprinting as a professional scientist.
