</p><p>In the enzyme kinetics case you will learn about the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and how to perform the enzyme kinetics experiment as well as learn about a condition caused by the improper functioning of alcohol dehydrogenase.
</p><p>You will be able to find all the related theory required to complete the case from this Wiki page.
</p><p>Good luck!
