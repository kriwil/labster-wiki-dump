Not all genes in the genome are expressed in all cells/tissues as the need and function of various cells/tissues differ. Therefore the consequences of a gene mutation will primarily affect tissues relying on and expressing that specific gene.
Techniques for detecting gene expression are for example northern blot, quantitative PCR and microarray.
