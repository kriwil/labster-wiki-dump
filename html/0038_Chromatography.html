This name was chosen by the Russian botanist, Tswett. He separated different pigments from a plant extract when passing a solvent through a column filled with calcium carbonate where the sample was placed. This was the start of this widely used and versatile technique.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Principles_of_Chromatography"> Principles of Chromatography </span></h2>
<p>Chromatography is based on the separation of sample components in a mixture. This separation takes place due to interactions between a stationary phase and a mobile phase. A mobile phase, as its name suggests, is a phase that travels through the stationary phase. Depending on the strength of interaction, the compounds can be more attracted to the stationary or the mobile phase. 
</p><p>The speed of a migrating sample component depends on whether the component has an affinity for the stationary or mobile phase. This affinity appears via various actions: adsorption, partition, ion exchange, etc. If the component has a higher affinity to the mobile phase, it will not spend too much time with the stationary phase and will be eluted quite fast. On the other hand, if the component has a higher affinity to the stationary phase, it will spend more time with the stationary phase and will be eluted later. The result is that the amount of time a compound stays in the column is different based on its property. Differences in this time lead to the separation of the compounds in the starting mixture.

<p>Generally chromatography techniques can be divided into 2 large classes. Depending on the stationary and mobile phases, different types of chromatography can be distinguished:
