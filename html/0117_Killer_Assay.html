<p>An in vitro model system must be established to assess the potency of potential drugs. Malaria parasites infect red blood cells, which do not contain a nucleus and therefore no DNA of their own; DNA concentration can be measured to infer parasite concentrations. This is usually achieved by using a molecule called SYBR Green, which binds to the minor groove of double-stranded DNA. The contact with the DNA molecule increases fluorescence of SYBR over 100 fold. Infected red blood cells are incubated with the potential drug and the DNA content of each sample is qualitatively measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. A positive and negative control has to be run parallel to the samples in order to evaluate the results.

<b>Plate setup</b><br/>
</p>
<ul><li>Infected cells + SYBR Green = positive control <br/>
</li><li>Uninfected cells + SYBR Green = negative control<br/>
</li><li>Infected cells + SYBR Green + antimalarial drug = sample<br/>
</li></ul>
<p>Infected cells contain P. falciparum parasites and human erythrocytes, which are in a RPMI medium containing human serum, glucose, hypoxanthine and gentamicin. Uninfected cells and infected cells have a similar composition, however the infected cells do not contain P.falciparum. To ensure homogeneous incubation conditions the samples are loaded in a 96-well microplate and incubated for 48 hours. Several replicas for each sample should be obtained to ensure consistent results. The drug potency can then be evaluated by comparing the average fluorescence of the samples with the two controls.
