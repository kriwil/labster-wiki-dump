<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Biosynthetic_pathway">Biosynthetic pathway</span></h3>
<p>Terpenoids are enzymatically synthesized from acetyl-CoA and pyruvate that are abundant in plastids and the cytoplasm. Formation of terpenoids takes place in peroxisomes. Plant terpenoids have diverse functions in membrane structure (sterols), photosynthesis (carotenoids), redox chemistry (quinones) and growth regulators (gibberellins, abscisic acids, brassinosteroids). Many terpenoids are economically valuable flavoring agents, perfumes, insecticides, anti-microbial agents, raw material for vitamins and drugs.
Terpenoids contribute to the scent of eucalyptus, the flavors of cinnamon, cloves and ginger, the yellow color of sunflowers and the red color in tomatoes
<br/>
</p><p>Even though terpenoids have a huge variety of structural and chemical properties, their terpene backbone is synthesized from only two five-carbon isomers. Those isomers are isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP).
</p><p>Terpene synthases are the primary enzymes responsible for catalyzing the formation of hemiterpenes (C<sub>5</sub>), monoterpenes (C<sub>10</sub>), sesquiterpenes (C<sub>15</sub>), or diterpenes (C<sub>20</sub>) from their substrates. <br/>
</p><p>Volatile terpens are usually direct products of the terpene synthase without additional oxidation, dehydrogenation, acylation or other reactions. 
</p><p>Cytochrome P450 catalyzes the oxidation of organic molecules such as terpenes. The monooxygenease reaction catalyzed by P450 inserts one oxygen into the aliphatic position of an organic substrate (RH) while the other oxygen atom is reduced to water.<br/>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Terpenoid_Extraction">Terpenoid Extraction</span></h3>
<p>Plant secondary metabolite such as terpenoid can be extracted using Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) method. In SFE, plant tissue are mixed with supercritical fluids/solvent to form a mobile phase. The process begins with CO<sub>2</sub> in gas form, which is compressed into the liquid phase before becoming supercritical. CO<sub>2</sub> in supercritical form can diffuse in plant tissues easily and dissolve secondary metabolites. Then the extracted material is separated from CO<sub>2</sub> by boiling it off at lower pressures. The used CO<sub>2</sub> can then be cooled, re-compressed and recycled, or discharged to the atmosphere. Therefore usage or toxic chemicals can be avoided.<br/>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Terpenoid_Evolution">Terpenoid Evolution</span></h3>
<p>Plant hemiterpene, monoterpene, sesquiterpene and diterpenes synthase are evolutionarily related to each other and are structurally distinct from triterpene or tetraterpene synthase. 
Metabolic engineering of the terpenoid pathway is a constantly improving tool, used for the fundamental study of terpenoid biosynthesis.
