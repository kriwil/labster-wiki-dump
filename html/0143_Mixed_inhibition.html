Lineweaver-Burk plots showing the 3 major types of inhibition.

<p>A mixed inhibitor interacts with the enzyme alone and with the enzyme-substrate complex. The double-reciprocal equation for mixed inhibition is as follows, as already mentioned [1]:

</p><p>For mixed inhibition, the Lineweaver-Burk plots show both different slopes and different y-intersects at different inhibitor concentrations. To calculate the parameters in this case, 2 new plots must be prepare: first, plot the intercepts against the inhibitor concentrations; this makes it possible to obtain K&#8217;<sub>I</sub> and V<sub>max</sub>, as described under un-competitive inhibition. Second, plot the slopes against the inhibitor concentrations; form this, K<sub>I</sub> can be found. The slope of this plot is k<sub>m</sub> / V<sub>max</sub>, therefore multiplying this slope with V<sub>max</sub> already obtained gives K<sub>m</sub>.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Non-competitive_inhibition">Non-competitive inhibition</span></h2>
<p>In the special case of mixed inhibition where &#945; = &#945;', i.e., K<sub>I</sub> = K'<sub>I</sub> , the type of inhibition is called <i>non-competitive inhibition</i>. In this special case, the inhibitor interacts in a favorable manner with the enzyme-substrate complex as it does with the enzyme alone. When plotting kinetic data in a Lineweaver-Burk plot, a <b>common x-intersect</b> shows that the competitor is non-competitive [1,2].
</p><p>The double-reciprocal equation for noncompetitive inhibition is  thus as follows:
</p><p><a href="/index.php/File:Double_reciprocal_non-competitive_inhibition_equation.png" class="image"><img alt="Double reciprocal non-competitive inhibition equation.png" src="/images/thumb/Double_reciprocal_non-competitive_inhibition_equation.png/266px-Double_reciprocal_non-competitive_inhibition_equation.png" width="266" height="80"/></a> where <a href="/index.php/File:Inhibition_alpha.png" class="image"><img alt="Inhibition alpha.png" src="/images/thumb/Inhibition_alpha.png/138px-Inhibition_alpha.png" width="138" height="80"/></a>
</p><p>When plotting kinetic data using a non-competitive inhibitor, the apparent K<sub>m</sub> remains the same as the actual K<sub>m</sub>, and it can be calculated from a Lineweaver-Burk plot in by dividing the slope with the y-intersect [1]. To calculate V<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>I</sub>, the y-intersects of the different lines obtained from linear regression of Lineweaver-Burk plots at different inhibitor concentrations must be plotted against the inhibitor concentration. When fitted using linear regression, V<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>I</sub> can be calculated from this plot in the same manner as that in the case of un-competitive inhibition: V<sub>max</sub> is calculated by taking the reciprocal to the y-intersect of this line, and K<sub>I</sub> is calculated by dividing the y-intersect with the slope.

<ul><li> Prepare Lineweaver-Burk plots of the kinetic data and fit the data using linear regression (1 fit per inhibitor concentration).
</li><li> Calculate K<sub>m</sub> by dividing the slope of any of these lines with the corresponding y-intersect (K<sub>m</sub> obtained should not depend on the line used).
</li><li> Plot the y-intersects of each of these fits as a function of the inhibitor concentration.
</li><li> To calculate V<sub>max</sub>, take the reciprocal of the y-intersect of this plot.
</li><li> To calculate K<sub>I</sub>, divide the y-intersect of this plot with the slope.
