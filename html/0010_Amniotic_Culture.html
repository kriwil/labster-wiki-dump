In order to obtain mitotic cell, a cell culture from amniotic fluid sample must be performed. Successful cell culture can be achieved by maintaining a prime amniotic fluid characteristic as follow:<br/>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Sterility</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>Amniotic fluid should be kept sterile. All laboratory work involving amniotic fluid must be performed inside the biosafety cabinet. Addition of antiobiotic such as penicillin and streptomycin into the amniotic fluid may slow cell culture. <br/>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Presence of blood</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>The presence of blood in the amniotic fluid is undesirable because it can increase the acidity of the culture and inhibit cell growth.<br/>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Harvest time</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>Culture harvest time is critical. Culture with high density is harder to identify hence the information that may have been useful in excluding mosaicism or interpreting abnormal results is lost. Cell with high confluency rate will have lower division rate and less mitosis available for analysis. Less mitotic cell also obtained if the culture was harvested too early. <br/>
</p><p><br/>
Generally an amniotic fluid sample completely processed within 10 days. The cell usually harvest by day 6 or 7. 
</p><p><br/>
Amniotic fluid consists of three major cell types, including:<br/>
</p>
<ul><li>Amniotic fluid cell: This cell is the major cell found in new culture. It has a pleomorphic appearance and has no maternal cell equivalent.
</li><li>Epithelial cell: This cell does not culture well. It has cuboidal shape. 
</li><li>Fibroblast cell: This cell has thin and elongated shape. It predominate the older culture.
</li></ul>
