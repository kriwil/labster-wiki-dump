The different visible bands relate to known fragment lengths, as can be observed to the right of the gel image, where fragment lengths are given in base pairs. The number to the far right gives the concentration of the particular fragment.</div></div></div>
<p>A DNA Ladder is a mix of DNA fragments with known lengths. It is used as a scale for determining the lengths of unknown DNA fragments. The size of the fragments is determined is by running a gel with the DNA ladder in a well next to the samples with unknown lengths. The bands showing from the DNA ladder have predetermined lengths such as "100 bp", "500 bp" and others. If a band from an unknown sample has run the same distance in the gel as the 500 bp band, it can be assumed that the unknown fragment has a length close or equal to 500.
