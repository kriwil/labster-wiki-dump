<p>Complementary DNA (cDNA) is DNA that is synthesized from messenger RNA molecules. cDNA synthesis is catalyzed by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which uses RNA as a template for DNA synthesis. Reverse transcriptase was initially found and isolated from a retrovirus. These viruses contain an RNA genome; therefore the viruses need to produce a cDNA copy of its genome to be compatible with the host cell's molecular machinery. <br/>
There are numerous approaches to synthesize cDNA; in this case, we will use the traditional approach to synthesize cDNA.

</p><p>Traditional cDNA synthesis:
</p>
<ul><li> An oligo(T) fragment is used as a primer in order to bind to the 3&#8217; poly(A)tail of each RNA.
</li><li> Reverse transcriptase uses RNA as template to synthesize cDNA strands. 
</li><li> The resulting RNA- cDNA hybrid is treated with alkali or RNase to hydrolyze the RNA.
</li><li> The stranded DNA folds back on itself and forms a loop at the 3&#8217; end. The resulting double stranded portion of the loop acts as a primer for the DNA polymerase, which synthesizes the complementary DNA strand.
</li><li> A S1 nuclease will cut the loop, resulting in double-stranded DNA.
</li></ul>
