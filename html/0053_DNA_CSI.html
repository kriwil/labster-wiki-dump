<p>DNA is the hereditary material of all living organisms, including humans. DNA stores information through a code made up of four chemical bases: A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine), and it is the order (or sequence) of these four bases that determine the information given by the DNA. The information is used as instructions for building and maintaining all the cells of an organism. The human genome consists of around 3.2 billion base pairs.

<b>How to collect a DNA sample</b>
</p><p>The DNA is stored in the nucleus of each cell. This means, that DNA can be harvested from any sample containing eukaryotic cells. Usually a blood sample is collected and the DNA is then extracted from the white blood cells (red blood cells do not contain a nucleus). If blood sampling is impossible or too risky (children, animals, forensics), smaller amounts of DNA can also be extracted from a mouth swap (contains epithelial cells) or a few hairs with bulp.
