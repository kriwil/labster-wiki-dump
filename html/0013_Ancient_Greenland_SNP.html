You can read more about these SNPs from [<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="external text" href="http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/SNPedia">SNPedia</a>]. Below is a list on some of the SNPs that were identified from the ancient Greenland man.

<ul><li> <b>Rs6152</b>
</li></ul>
<p>This SNP is located in the first exon of Androgen Receptor gene located on the X chromosome. It is a strong indicative marker for males to develop a baldness pattern. Males with the risk allele G have a high risk of developing male pattern baldness. But the baldness probability varies depending on age and other factors.

<ul><li> <b>Rs1426654</b>
</li></ul>
<p>This SNP influences the skin pigmentation. People having allele A are indicated to be light-skinned European ancestry. This SNP is estimated to spread through the European population approximately 6,000 - 12,000 years ago. Prior to that, European ancestors were estimated to have relatively brown skin.

</p>
<ul><li> <b>Rs17822931</b>
</li></ul>
<p>This is 1 of the most famous SNP identified. It is located in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP) which is a member of ABCC11 gene. People having allele T/T commonly have dry ear wax and come from the Asian ancestry, whereas people having allele C/C commonly have wet ear wax and come from the European or African ancestry. This SNP is also associated with sweat production and lipid secretion.

</p>
<ul><li> <b>Rs1129038</b>
</li></ul>
<p>This SNP is located on chromosome 15, allele A/A is found in 97% of all Caucasians with blue eyes. People with allele C/C do not have blue eyes, instead they have brown eyes. 
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Rs3827760</b>
</li></ul>
<p>This SNP is located in EDAR (Ectodysplasin A Receptor) gene on position 1540. It is associated with hair thickness and tooth shape among Asians. People having C in the 1540 position instead of T are associated with having shovel shaped tooth. It is predominantly found in East Asian populations and absent in populations of African and European origins. The 1540C allele has also been associated with Asian-specific hair thickness.
