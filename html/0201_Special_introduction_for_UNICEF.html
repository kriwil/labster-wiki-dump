<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Labster developed this CSI case in collaboration with Danmark Tekniske Universitet (DTU). The user of this case are entry level undergraduate students studying biotechnology with most of them having some biotechnology background knowledge. 
</p><p>In the CSI case, students need to utilize their scientific knowledge in DNA profiling in order to run PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and gel electrophoresis and solve the case. By using Labster, students learn how to work in a laboratory environment as well as learning how science can be applied in real life situation. 
</p><p>Students start by reading the background theory and then continuing to the virtual laboratory. They are also presented with quiz questions throughout the laboratory. If they do not know the answer, students can always click on the "view theory" button and go back to the Wiki page discussing the related theory. The case ends once students have completed the laboratory exercises, answered all the quiz questions and convict the murderer.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Guiding_materials_for_you">Guiding materials for you</span></h2>
<p>We have specially prepared some tools for you to be able to go through our CSI case even if you do not have any biotechnology background. We suggest you to go through the case in similar way to the students. However we have extra materials for you if you get stuck.
</p><p><b>1. Read the theory in the Wiki pages</b>
</p><p>You are most welcome to read through the whole theory. This will provide you with sufficient knowledge to complete the case. Click on the link below to view the theory ... 
You also have the option to go directly into the lab. We will provide you with detailed instructions and a video walk through of the CSI case should you cannot proceed by yourself.
</p><p>2. Get started with Labster
</p><p>Labster is ran through Unity3D. If you do not have Unity3D player installed in your computer, you will need to install one. An option to install Unity3D is presented on the main page of the CSI case. 
You will need to allow your web browser for pop-ups in order to link the "view theory" button to the correct page in the Wiki.
You need to create a username as a password to log into the CSI case.
</p><p>3. Should you get stuck at any step in the case, don't worry! We have prepared a detailed instruction including the correct answers for all the quiz questions and a walk through video clip that you can find below. 
We want everyone to be able to enjoy our CSI case!
