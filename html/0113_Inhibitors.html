<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Enzyme_inhibition">Enzyme inhibition</span></h2>
<p>Enzyme inhibitors are molecules that decrease the activity of <a href="/index.php/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a>, and knowledge about inhibitors can, for example, be used in developing drugs or in the study of biochemical pathways, because inhibitors provide a way to interfere with these pathways. Enzyme inhibitors can be either irreversible or reversible; irreversible inhibitors decrease enzymatic activity by destroying the enzyme through various mechanisms, while reversible inhibitors keep the enzyme functional. The inhibitors we will study here are reversible inhibitors [1].
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_inhibition">Types of inhibition</span></h2>
<p>The mechanisms of enzyme inhibitors can be classified into 3 major groups: Competitive inhibitors, uncompetitive inhibitors , and mixed inhibitors. Competitive inhibitors work by binding to the active site of the enzyme in competition with the substrate; uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme-substrate complex at a site distinct from the active site, but they cannot bind to the enzyme alone; and mixed inhibitors can bind to both the enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex at a site distinct from the active site [1].
</p><p><br/>
The mechanisms of enzyme inhibition can be thought of as an extension to the <a href="/index.php?title=Michaelis-Menten&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Michaelis-Menten (page does not exist)">Michaelis-Menten mechanism</a> and competitive and un-competitive inhibition can be regarded a special case of mixed inhibition: 
</p><p><a href="/index.php/File:Mixed_inhibition_mechanism.png" class="image"><img alt="Mixed inhibition mechanism.png" src="/images/thumb/Mixed_inhibition_mechanism.png/262px-Mixed_inhibition_mechanism.png" width="262" height="150"/></a>
</p><p>where K<sub>I</sub> and K&#8217;<sub>I</sub> are the dissociation constants of the EI and ESI complex, respectively. Using the same approach as that used for deriving the Michaelis-Menten equation (for a detailed derivation, see [2]), the following equation for mixed inhibition can be obtained:
</p><p><a href="/index.php/File:Mixed_inhibition_equation.png" class="image"><img alt="Mixed inhibition equation.png" src="/images/thumb/Mixed_inhibition_equation.png/217px-Mixed_inhibition_equation.png" width="217" height="80"/></a> where <a href="/index.php/File:Inhibition_alpha.png" class="image"><img alt="Inhibition alpha.png" src="/images/thumb/Inhibition_alpha.png/138px-Inhibition_alpha.png" width="138" height="80"/></a> and <a href="/index.php/File:Inhibition_alpha%27.png" class="image"><img alt="Inhibition alpha'.png" src="/images/thumb/Inhibition_alpha%27.png/158px-Inhibition_alpha%27.png" width="158" height="80"/></a>
</p><p><br/>
Just like the Michealis-Menten equation, this equation can be rearranged to fit a double-reciprocal plot:
</p><p><a href="/index.php/File:Double_reciprocal_mixed_inhibition_equation.png" class="image"><img alt="Double reciprocal mixed inhibition equation.png" src="/images/thumb/Double_reciprocal_mixed_inhibition_equation.png/266px-Double_reciprocal_mixed_inhibition_equation.png" width="266" height="80"/></a> 
</p><p>If &#945; &gt; 1 and &#945;&#8217; &gt; 1, the inhibition is mixed; for competitive inhibition, &#945;&#8217; = 1; for uncompetitive inhibition, &#945; = 1. Thus, 3 different equations are obtained for the 3 different types of inhibition, and a <a href="/index.php/Km" title="Km">Lineweaver-Burk</a> plot of the kinetic data can reveal the type of inhibition that the inhibitor performs. This will be explained in the following pages [1,2].
</p><p><br/>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Methanol_poisoning">Methanol poisoning</span></h2>
<p>The enzyme <a href="/index.php/ADH" title="ADH">alcohol dehydrogenase</a> is not completely specific for ethanol; it also catalyzes the formation of aldehydes from other alcohols. One of these alcohols is methanol, which is metabolized into formaldehyde and other toxic compounds that can cause blindness or death [3]. Methanol poisoning is quite common, and can be caused by the ingestion of homemade alcohol. Methanol and ethanol are thus competitive substrates, and ethanol is actually used to prevent poising after the ingestion of methanol, because it inhibits ADH in catalyzing the oxidation of this compound [4].
