</p><p><br/>
In the HPLC case you will learn about principles of HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) and use it to study drug stability. By using HPLC, you can separate the different drug components as well as measure their concentrations. At the end of the case, you will use HPLC and compare the medicine that has been stored in normal room temperature versus medicine that has been stored in extreme conditions.
</p><p><br/>
You will be able to find all the related theory needed to complete the case from this Wiki page.
</p><p><br/>
Good luck!
