<p>Nucleotides are the units on which <a href="/index.php/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> is built. They are made up of a sugar molecule (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA), a phosphate group, and a base. The sugar molecule is bound to both the phosphate group and the base. Four types of nucleotides can be found in DNA according to the which base that is bound to the sugar molecule. The four bases are A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine) and G (guanine).
