<p>Sequencing is a technique used for "reading" the order of bases in a DNA fragment. Small DNA fragments, whole genes, or even genomes can be sequenced. The most widely used sequencing technique is Sanger sequencing. This method is very similar to PCR but involves only one primer, which anneals close to the region of interest, and the nucleotides are a mixture of normal nucleotides (dATP,dTTP,dCTP and dGTP)  and "stop"-nucleotides (ddATP, ddTTP, ddCTP, and ddGTP), which are each marked with their color. In every cycle the target DNA is replicated until a ddNTP is added and the polymerase stops the replication. After 35 cycles, a large number of fragments in all different lengths are produced. These fragments are run in a specialized acrylamide gel where their length and "end-base" are detected. Because the fragments are seperated based on size in the gel, the bases are detected one by one thus, producing the sequence.
The purpose of sequencing is for example, to predict the protein sequence of a gene, to compare species on a sequence level (genes or genome), or to search for a mutation.
