<ul><li>MIcrobial cells(biomass)production, eg. bakers yeast.
</li><li>Microbial metabolites production, eg. ethanol.
</li><li>Microbial enzymes, eg. hydrolases
</li><li>Recombinant products production, eg. human insulin produced in yeast.
</li></ul>
<p>There are several types of fermentations. The most important are Batch, Fedbatch and Chemostat.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Batch_Fermentation">Batch Fermentation</span></h3>
<p>In the fermentation case we used batch fermentation to produce bioethanol. In batch fermentation nothing else is put or taken out until the reaction is done. In batch fermentation, there is no nutrients addition during fermentation so exponential growth of cell is limited to a few generations.

<p><br/>
The phase of microbial growth in batch fermentation is generally divided into four phase which are lag phase, log phase or exponential phase and stationary phase. In lag phase, microbes are growing and adapting to new environment so the biomass is not increasing significantly. During the log phase, nutrient consumption is in maximum state hence maximum biomass is achieved. Since it is a batch fermentation where no additional nutrients was added, nutrient will be depleted and growth rate decrease and becomes zero.
