Adenine (A) is added at the 3' end of the DNA sample. As you remember, Adenine pairs up specifically with Thymine. The adapters have Thymine at the 3' end that will specifically bind to the 3' Adenine of the DNA sample. 
</p><p><br/>
A non-proof reading Polymerase such as <i>Taq</i> could be use to add an Adenine at the 3' of the blunt end DNA.
