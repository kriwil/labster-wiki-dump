Blood types
-----------

In order to understand the different groups of blood, it is necessary to
understand the following concepts:

-   Allele: One member of a pair of genes placed in a specific spot on a
    chromosome (locus)
-   Genotype: A set of alleles that determines the expression of a
    particular characteristic.
-   Phenotype: The physical appearance or biochemical characteristic of
    an organism, result from the expression of its genes.
-   Antigen: Substance produced by the cell as part of normal cell
    metabolism or when the cell is infected by bacteria or viruses.
-   Antibody: Proteins that act against non-self antigens.

### ABO group system

The main alleles in relation to blood typing are A, B and O. In the
table below, all possible genotypes and phenotypes are shown. Notice
that the phenotype is decided by the dominant allele of the genotype. A
and B are co-dominant, whereas O is recessive.

  ---------------- ----------------- --------------------------- ---------------------------
  A                AA, AO            A Antigen                   Anti-B
                                                                 

  B                BB, BO            B antigen                   Anti-A
                                                                 

  AB               AB                Both A and B antigens       Neither anti-A nor anti-B
                                                                 

  O                OO                Neither A nor B antigens    Both Anti-A and Anti-B

### Rhesus group system

Rhesus (Rh) group system is the most important blood group after ABO
system. It is denoted with a positive or negative sign after ABO type of
the person. Positive relates to the presence of an extra antigen, D
antigen, and negative relates to the absence of this antigen.

Transfusions
------------

When transfusions are needed, knowing the type of blood is very
important. ABO and Rh are taken into consideration when transferring
blood to a patient. Receiving wrong blood type leads to agglutination of
the red blood cells and other immunological or infectious complications.
Some of these problems can be lethal for the patient.

Agglutination occurs when an antibody reacts with the specific antigen.
As an example, antibodies Anti-A react with A antigens and thus, blood
containing antibodies Anti-A cannot be given to a patient whose blood
contains A antigens. The same happens with the rest of antigens and
antibodies. In the table below you have a summary of what types of blood
can be received or donate in each case. According to the table, AB+ is
the “universal receptor” since they can receive any type of blood and O-
is the “universal donor” since they can donate their blood to any person
without having agglutination problems.

Blood typing
------------

We have already learned why it is so important to donate the appropriate
type of blood to a patient when transfusions are needed. Therefore, it
is also important to know how you can determine the blood group.

This can be done in a card where you can find three circles containing
the specific antibodies of antigens A, B and D, that is, antibodies
Anti-A, Anti-B and Anti-D. There is a fourth circle without any
antibodies that is used as a control to make sure that the test was
performed correctly.

In order to perform the test, you need to add one drop of water and then
a drop of blood in each of the four circles and spread them all over the
surface of the circles. You need to use different materials for each
circle to avoid contamination among them. If the tested blood contains
antigens A, B or D, they will react with the specific antibodies of the
circles, and blood clots will be formed. In the following image, all the
possible results are shown. Notice that if the control shows blood
clots, it means that something went wrong in the test and you should
repeat it with another card to trust the result.
