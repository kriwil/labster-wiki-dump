The catalytic constant (k~cat~) or turnover number is the number of
enzymatic reactions a single saturated enzyme molecule can catalyze per
unit of time, usually expressed in s^-1^. k~cat~ is not dependent on the
concentration of the enzyme, and is therefore a better parameter than
[V~max~](vmax "wikilink") for comparing different enzymes. Because
k~cat~ is the maximum number of chemical reactions a single enzyme
molecule can catalyze, the maximum velocity (V~max~) at a specific
enzyme concentration is obtained by multiplying k~cat~ with the
concentration of the enzyme ([E]), i.e., V~max~ = k~cat~ • [E]. This
means, that if V~max~ and [E], which can be experimentally measured, are
known, k~cat~ can be calculated as follows [1].
