Complementary DNA (cDNA) is DNA that is synthesized from messenger RNA
molecules. cDNA synthesis is catalyzed by an enzyme called reverse
transcriptase, which uses RNA as a template for DNA synthesis. Reverse
transcriptase was initially found and isolated from a retrovirus. These
viruses contain an RNA genome; therefore the viruses need to produce a
cDNA copy of its genome to be compatible with the host cell's molecular
machinery.\
There are numerous approaches to synthesize cDNA; in this case, we will
use the traditional approach to synthesize cDNA.

Traditional cDNA synthesis:

-   An oligo(T) fragment is used as a primer in order to bind to the 3’
    poly(A)tail of each RNA.
-   Reverse transcriptase uses RNA as template to synthesize cDNA
    strands.
-   The resulting RNA- cDNA hybrid is treated with alkali or RNase to
    hydrolyze the RNA.
-   The stranded DNA folds back on itself and forms a loop at the 3’
    end. The resulting double stranded portion of the loop acts as a
    primer for the DNA polymerase, which synthesizes the complementary
    DNA strand.
-   A S1 nuclease will cut the loop, resulting in double-stranded DNA.
