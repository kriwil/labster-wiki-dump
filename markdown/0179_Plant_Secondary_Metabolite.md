Beside primary metabolites, which are essential for plant growth, in
addition plants also produce various secondary metabolites which are
important for the plants to adjust to their environment. Primary
metabolites include amino acids, nucleotides, sugars and lipids.
Secondary metabolites are very diverse and often unique to a few closely
related species. Depending on the precursor derived from the primary
metabolism, secondary metabolites are divided into three groups:\
• Terpenes and Terpenoids\
• Phenolic and polyphenolic compounds\
• Nitrogen/sulphur containing compounds\
 Secondary metabolites fulfill many different functions such as
protection from herbivores and microbial pathogens or attractants for
pollinators. Many secondary metabolites are important as industrial
materials, flavors, coloring, poisons and medicinal drugs.\

### Terpenes and Terpenoids

Terpenoids, or isoprenoids, are the largest group of natural compounds.
Terpenoids consist of a highly non-polar terpene backbone with
functional groups attached to it. Therefore terpenoids are mostly
insoluble in water. As plant plant defense molecules, many terpenoids
are biologically active. Therefore terpenoids can be used for treating
human diseases. Well-known terpenoids include menthol, cannabinoids,
citral and the curcuminoids found in turmeric and mustard seed. Most
terpenes are associated with distinct flavors.

Artemisinin, produced by *Artemisinin annua*, is a sesquiterpenoid
antimalarial theraputic. When the malaria parasite invades a red blood
cell and digests the hemoglobin it causes oxidative stress. This
initiates a chemical reaction of arthemisinin which becomes highly
reactive and perturbs the redox homeostasis in the parasite. The precise
mechanism of action is still unknown.

### Phenolics

Phenolic compounds contain a phenol group. One of the largest classes of
phenolic compounds are the flavonoids. The yellow pigmentation of citrus
fruits is derived from flavonoids. They are also contained in berries,
dark chocolate and red wine. Flavonoids have important
anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and anti-cancer activities due to their
powerful anti-oxidant properties.

### Nitrogen-Containing Compounds

Nitrogen-containing compounds are diverse plant secondary metabolites
that contain nitrogen in their structure. This class include alkaloids
and cyanogenic glycosides which are famous for their toxicity and
medicinal properties. Alkaloids acts as defence molecules against
herbivores, especially mammals. Cyanogenic glycosides are known for
their capabilities to release volatile poisonous hydrogen cyanide (HCN).
