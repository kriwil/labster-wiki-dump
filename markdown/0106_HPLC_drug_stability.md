Welcome to Labster's HPLC case!

In the HPLC case you will learn about principles of HPLC (High
Performance Liquid Chromatography) and use it to study drug stability.
By using HPLC, you can separate the different drug components as well as
measure their concentrations. At the end of the case, you will use HPLC
and compare the medicine that has been stored in normal room temperature
versus medicine that has been stored in extreme conditions.

You will be able to find all the related theory needed to complete the
case from this Wiki page.

Good luck!

HPLC case progression
---------------------

-   Identify different HPLC machine compartments
-   Sample preparation
-   Separate the medicine ingredients
-   Analyze using different parameters
-   Analyze the medicine stored in 2 conditions
