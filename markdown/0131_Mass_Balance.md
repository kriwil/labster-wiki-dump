**Black box modelling**\
In black box model, the input and output of the system are analyzed
instead of the processes inside a system itself. The first laws of
thermodynamics explained that there is no modification of the total
amount of matter participating during any chemical or physical change.
The first law of thermodynamics can be expressed in equation:\
*M*~input~ + *M*~produce~ - *M*~output~ - *M*~consume~ =
*M*~accumulated~

Under steady state condition, in which the concentration of chemicals
and the other system are constatnt, the amount of accumulated matter,
*M*~accumulated~ is zero. It is valid for carbon analysis in batch
processes with chemoheterotroph organism such as yeast.

*M*~input~ + *M*~produce~ - *M*~output~ - *M*~consume~ = 0

**Carbon balance**
