### Plotting the data

**Step 1.** Now you have your data you should show them in a graph.
Chose "Insert" and select "scatter", see picture 1. Chose "select data"
in the top, and click "add", see picture 2.\

**Step 2.** Now chose the time as the x-coordinates(the green arrow on
picture 3), and biomass and the y-coordinate(the red arrow). Give the
series name "Biomass". Click Ok.\
 **Step 3.** Great job. Repeat this for all the data.\

**Step 4.** When you have done this you should alter O~2~ and CO~2~.
Right click on the plots of O~2~, see picture 4. Then chose "Format
dataseries". A pop-up menu appears, see picture 5. Click "Secondary
axis", under "plot on". Do the same thing for CO~2~.\
 **Step 5.** Finally you can add the units for the axis, using the
"layout-options", see picture 6.\
Good job. It looks very good!

### Regression analysis

You will need to perform an regression analysis, for instance to find
the specific growth rate. This is quite easy. First lets make the data.
Click on a new column, next to the data. Press. "=ln()". Within the
parenthesis add the coordinate for the first biomass datapoint. For
instance: "=ln(B2)", see picture 7.\
Next you can click in the bottom of that cell, and drag the command, to
transform all the biomass data, see picture 8. This way you have
calculated ln(biomass) very quickly.\

The next thing to do is make a plot of ln(biomass) over time. Repeat the
procedure of plotting data.\
When you have done this you simply right click on a datapoint in the
plots, and chose "add trendline", see picture 9. A pop-up menu appears.
Add the linear regression, and remember to click "show equation in
plot". You should now have something that looks like picture 10.\
You are now a master in excel. Great job!.
