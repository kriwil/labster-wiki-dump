When a trait is more frequently observed in some families/breeds than
others, a hereditary etiology may be suspected. Because family/breed
members often share the same environment, environmental factors (eg.
diet and housing) must be examined and excluded. The next step is then
to collect family and phenotype data for a pedigree to get an overview
of the inheritance pattern.
