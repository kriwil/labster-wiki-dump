Mutations are changes in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA as compared
with a wild type sequence.

Mutations are categorized according to how they change the order of
bases:

Substitution: one base is replaced by another

Deletion: one or more bases are deleted

Insertions: one or more bases are inserted

(Chapter 7 page 200)

Mutations in coding sequences are categorized according to their effect
on the protein:

Synonymous/silent mutation: a substitution that does not change the
amino acid

Non-synonymous/missense mutation: a substitution that changes the amino
acid

Nonsense mutation: generates a stop codon

Frameshift mutation: insertion or deletion not divisible by 3 that
alters the reading frame

(Chapter 8 page 276)
