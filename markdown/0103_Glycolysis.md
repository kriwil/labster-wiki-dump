Glycolysis or the Embden-Meyerhof pathway is a metabolic pathway to
begin the break down of glucose. This pathway is used by most
autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms, both aerobes and anaerobes.
Glycolysis does not require oxygen; however, it can occur in the absence
or presence of oxygen. Glycolysis consists of four important steps:

-   Glucose phosphorylation
-   Breakdown of six-carbon molecule (glucose) into three- carbon
    molecule
-   Transfer of two electrons to coenzyme NAD
-   Energy capturing in ATP

The end products of glycolysis are two ATP molecules, two pyruvic acids,
and two molecule of NADH.
