The detector is the part of the HPLC system where the analytes that come
out of the column are identified and quantified (calculation of the
concentration). The outcome of the detector is processed by the computer
and the typical outcome is a chromatogram representing the signal
strength vs. the retention time. The signal strength measures the amount
of analyte that is detected by the detector. By comparing this signal
strength to a calibration curve, we can know the exact concentration of
the analyte. The retention time is the time that the analyte needs from
the time of sample injection to travel through the column and then
passing the detector.

Specific detectors:
-------------------

![**UV-vis detector**. The light travels from the source passing through a slit and dispersed into various wavelength using dispersion device (a prism). The light then passes another slit called the exit slit. This slit acts as a selector only allowing a certain wavelength to pass and go through the sample. The amount of light that successfully went through the sample is then quantified by the detector.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/labster/wiki/media/UV-Vis_detector.png "UV-vis detector.

-   **UV-Vis Detector**: The signal (also called response) corresponds
    to the absorbance of structure absorbing UV light of a specific
    compound or group of compounds. The higher the concentration, the
    higher the absorbance.
-   **Photodiode Array (PDA) Detector**: PDA is used in combination with
    UV and creates a wavelength scan for each compound. By using PDA it
    is possible to monitor several wavelengths at the same time.
-   **Fluorescence Detector**: The signal corresponds to the
    fluorescence of compounds. Sample with higher concentration will
    emit stronger signal. Fluorescence detector is the most sensitive
    among modern HPLC detector.
-   **Mass Spectroscopic (MS) Detector**: MS works by creating an ions
    from sample molecules. These ions will provide information about the
    molecular weight of the compound. These ions can be generate by
    fragmentation of the compounds due to an applied electric field. The
    higher the concentration, the higher the amount of fragments and the
    higher the signal.

Other detectors:
----------------

-   **Refractive Index Detector**: Based on changes in the refractive
    index when light passes through the eluted compounds.
-   **Electrochemical Detector**: Based on electrochemical oxidation or
    reduction of the analytes on the surface of an electrode.
-   **Light Scattering Detectors**: The response is based on the light
    scattered by the molecules from a laser source and is proportional
    to the mass of the analytes.

UV spectroscopy is the most widely used detector for liquid
chromatography. Most compounds can be detected by UV with good
sensitivity (typically to 1-10ng range). However not all compounds can
be detected by a UV-vis detector. For example saturated hydrocarbons and
sugars lacking double bonds are very difficult to detect using UV
detector, such as: methane, butane, pentane, hexane, octane etc. These
molecules have sigma bonds (σ) that is very stable and require a lot of
energy to excite them. This is why they are difficult to detect using UV
detector.
