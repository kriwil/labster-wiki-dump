In order to perform chromosomal analysis, mitotic cell from the fetus is
required. In order to obtain mitotic cell, a cell culture from amniotic
fluid sample must be performed. Successful cell culture can be achieved
by maintaining a prime amniotic fluid characteristic as follow:\

-   **Sterility**\

Amniotic fluid should be kept sterile. All laboratory work involving
amniotic fluid must be performed inside the biosafety cabinet. Addition
of antiobiotic such as penicillin and streptomycin into the amniotic
fluid may slow cell culture.\

-   **Presence of blood**\

The presence of blood in the amniotic fluid is undesirable because it
can increase the acidity of the culture and inhibit cell growth.\

-   **Harvest time**\

Culture harvest time is critical. Culture with high density is harder to
identify hence the information that may have been useful in excluding
mosaicism or interpreting abnormal results is lost. Cell with high
confluency rate will have lower division rate and less mitosis available
for analysis. Less mitotic cell also obtained if the culture was
harvested too early.\

Generally an amniotic fluid sample completely processed within 10 days.
The cell usually harvest by day 6 or 7.

Amniotic fluid consists of three major cell types, including:\
\*Amniotic fluid cell: This cell is the major cell found in new culture.
It has a pleomorphic appearance and has no maternal cell equivalent.

-   Epithelial cell: This cell does not culture well. It has cuboidal
    shape.
-   Fibroblast cell: This cell has thin and elongated shape. It
    predominate the older culture.
