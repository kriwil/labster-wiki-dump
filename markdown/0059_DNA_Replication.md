When a cell prepares to divide, all its DNA is copied to produce two new
DNA molecules. This process is known as replication and it ensures that
all DNA in a cell is passed along to the daughter cells. DNA is
replicated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase, which makes a copy of a
DNA strand by connecting nucleotides to each other in the same sequence
as in the original, template DNA.
