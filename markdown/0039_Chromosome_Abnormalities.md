Chromosomal abnormality reflects an alteration of chromosome number or
structure. These alteration can been seen under the light microscope.
Chromosome abnormalities can be inherited from a parent (such as a
translocation) or be "de novo" (new to the individual).\

Chromosome abnormalities often associate with a syndrome. A syndrome
involves more organs or features – a complex of symptoms. A syndrome can
be sporadic, often with no known cause, or it can be caused by a gene
mutation or a chromosomal abnormality. Example of most common occurred
syndrome are Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Turner syndrome (45,X) and
Klinefelter syndrome(47,XXY).

Numerical abnormalities
-----------------------

Alteration in chromosome number which either missing or addition of
chromosome pair. Aneuploidy is the condition in which there is either an
extra chromosome or a missing chromosome. Aneuploidy is the most common
type of chromosomal disorder which occurring in 4% of live birth.
Example of numerical abnormalities is Down syndrome, also known as
Trisomy 21.

Trisomy is a term to describe a three times occurrence of particular
chromosome.

Structural abnormalities
------------------------

Several form of structural abnormalities are:\
\***Deletion**: A part of the chromosome is missing or deleted.

-   **Inversion**: A part of the chromosome has broken off, turned
    upside down and reattached.
    -   **Paracentric inversion**: chromosome are breaks on the same
        side of the centromere, so the overall shape of the chromosome
        is unchanged

-   -   **Pericentric inversion**: chromosome breaks at either side of
        the centromere. This change the shape of the chromosome and the
        position of the centromere.
-   **Translocation**: A part of one the chromosome is exchanged with
    part of to another chromosome.
    -   **Reciprocal translocation**: when two non-homologous chromosome
        exchange pieces. Individual who carry reciprocal translocation
        are phenotypically normal because all the information is
        present. The most common reciprocal translocation happens
        between long arms of chromosome 22 and chromosome 9 is present.
    -   **Robersonian translocation**: when two acrocentric chromosome
        breaks near the centromeres and rejoin in a way that results in
        the fusion at the centromere of the q arms and loss of the p
        arm. Individual who carry the Robertsonian translocation appears
        phenotypically normal, but experience a large number of
        spontaneous abortions due to the production of monosomic and
        trisomic embryos.

-   **Duplication**: A part of the chromosome is duplicated, resulting
    in extra genetic material.

Duplication of 9p
-----------------

![Chromosome 9 banding pattern](/wiki/chromosome 9.jpg "fig:Chromosome 9 banding pattern") Extra

chromosome material from the short arm of chromosome 9 (9p) in the cells
of the body. The extra material may consist of the entire short arm,
part of the short arm or include some of the long arm (9q). Duplication
of 9p also called 9p duplication syndrome, trisomy 9p syndrome or
partial trisomy 9p.

Almost 150 cases of duplication 9p have been found since 1970. Major
clinical feature observed in trisomy 9p syndrome include small sature,
mental retardation, deep set eyes, down-turned mouth, low-set ears,
microcephaly/brachycephaly, down-slanting palpebral fissures, prominent
nose,single palmar crease, hypoplasia of some phalanges, and hypoplastic
nail dysplasia.\
Other feature that found when a larger part of 9p is duplicated is cleft
lip or palate, small lower jaw, talipes and conginetal hip dislocation.

### Inheritance

A trisomy 9p could be inherited from a maternal balance reciprocal
translocation. Trisomy 9p is a well-described chromosomal aberration
associated with mental and growth retardation.

In this case the father has normal karyotype: **46,XY**, while the
mother is a carrier of reciprocal translocation with karyotype:
**46,XX,t(9;22)(p10;q10)**. In plain word the mother has balanced
reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22, with breaks in
9p10 (short arm band 10 of chromosome 9) and 22q10 (long arm band 10 of
chromosome 22).

From the aCGH result we know that fetus has dup(9)(p13.1pter) or in
plain word a duplication of chromosome 9p (short arm). From the
karyotyping we found that the fetus karyotype is
**46,XY,der(22)t(9;22)** which means, the boy has two normal chromosome
9 and derivative chromosome 22 with an extra segment of chromosome 9
from the mother and normal chromosome 22 from the father. Hence the
fetus was trisomic for 9p13.1 → pter.
