Welcome to Labster's Next Generation Sequencing case!

In the Next Generation Sequencing case, you will sequence the DNA of an
ancient Greenland man. You will learn about the different steps required
from having a purified DNA sample into the Next Generation Sequencing
data. You will also analyze the sequencing data and do a SNP analysis
where you can determine the physical characteristics of the ancient
Greenlandic man.

You will be able to find all the related theory required to complete the
case from this Wiki page.

Good luck!
