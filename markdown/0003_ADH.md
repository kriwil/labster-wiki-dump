![Structure of alcohol dehydrogenase ADH1B\*1 (from PDB entry
1HSZ)]( 1HSZ.png "fig:Structure of alcohol dehydrogenase ADH1B*1 (from PDB entry 1HSZ)")
The first step in the metabolism of alcohol in humans is catalyzed by
the [enzyme](/wiki/enzyme "wikilink") Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH). ADH
catalyzes the oxidation of a broad range of substrates containing
hydroxyl groups, including ethanol. In the case of ethanol, the alcohol
is converted into acetaldehyde, another toxic compound, which is then
metabolized further. To proceed, the reaction requires the oxidizing
agent Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD^+^). NAD^+^ is a co-enzyme
that acts as an electron acceptor, accepting 2 electrons and an H^+^
from ethanol [1]. Thus, ADH catalyzes the following reaction:

When performing kinetic assays, it is important to start measuring
immediately after the enzyme is added, because this reaction occurs as
soon as ADH is mixed with NAD^+^ and ethanol.

Humans have several different versions (isozymes) of ADH. Two of these,
called ADH1B\*1 and ADH1B\*2, differ in only 1 amino acid residue,
however the 2 isozymes show significant differences in kinetic
properties. Where ADH1B\*1 has an arginine residue at position 47,
ADH1B\*2 has a histidine residue at that position. ADH1B\*2 is more
common among East Asians, while ADH1B\*1 is common among Caucasians
[2,3].

The kinetic differences are due to the chemical properties of arginine
and histidine. Arginine in ADH1B\*1 forms ionic bonds with the
pyrophosphate group of NAD^+^, however the histidine residue in ADH1B\*2
is not able to form the same bonds. This means that ADH1B\*2 does not
bind NAD^+^ as tightly as ADH1B\*1, leading to a higher
[K~m~](/wiki/km "wikilink") value for ADH1B\*2. The rate-determining step of
the overall reaction is the dissociation of NADH; therefore, the
[turnover number](/wiki/kcat "wikilink") and [V~max~](/wiki/vmax "wikilink") of
ADH1B\*2 are higher, because NADH is not bound as tightly. Furthermore,
because the pKa value of histidine is lower than that of arginine, the
optimal pH of ADH1B\*2 (8.5) is lower than that of ADH1B\*1 (10.0) [4].

Individuals possessing the ADH1B\*2 isozyme experience the condition
called Asian glow. The condition leads to flushing and other symptoms
usually associated with hangovers after the consumption of even small
amounts of alcohol. These symptoms are caused by an elevated level of
acetaldehyde in the blood, which is due to higher activity of ADH1B\*2
than ADH1B\*1. Thus, the single amino acid substitution in ADH1B\*2,
caused by a mutation in DNA, leads to the Asian glow condition [5].
