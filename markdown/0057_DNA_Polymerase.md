DNA polymerase is the enzyme that is responsible for the formation of a
DNA strand from a template DNA strand. For the DNA polymerase to
initiate the formation of a new DNA strand, it needs a short "starter"
strand, called a [Primer](/wiki/Primers "wikilink"). The primer must be bound
to an area of the template DNA to which it is complementary.

### Synthesis of a new DNA strand

DNA polymerase can add nucleotides to the 3' end of a primer bound to
the template DNA because this end has a free hydroxyl group (-OH) that
can react with the phosphate group of the incoming nucleotide.
Therefore, the new DNA strand is said to be synthesized in the 5'→3'
direction. The new DNA strand will be complementary to the template
strand, and antiparallel.

### The making of a thermostable DNA polymerase (Taq) for [PCR](/wiki/PCR "wikilink")

DNA polymerase originates from living organisms and is most functional
at physiological conditions. Hence, the DNA polymerase from most
organisms would not work well in a PCR reaction because most polymerases
degrade at 90^o^C. If such a polymerase was to be used for PCR, it would
be necessary to add new DNA polymerase after each cycle. Luckily, a
suitable DNA polymerase was discovered by Thomas Brock: the Taq
polymerase. This DNA polymerase was isolated from the bacterium *Thermus
aquaticus* found in the hot springs at Yellowstone National Park. The
Taq polymerase is active at temperatures up to 95^o^C. This ensures that
multiple cycles of PCR can be performed in a single continuous event,
and no additional polymerase is required.
