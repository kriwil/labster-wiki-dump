Sequencing is a technique used for "reading" the order of bases in a DNA
fragment. Small DNA fragments, whole genes, or even genomes can be
sequenced. The most widely used sequencing technique is Sanger
sequencing. This method is very similar to PCR but involves only one
primer, which anneals close to the region of interest, and the
nucleotides are a mixture of normal nucleotides (dATP,dTTP,dCTP and
dGTP) and "stop"-nucleotides (ddATP, ddTTP, ddCTP, and ddGTP), which are
each marked with their color. In every cycle the target DNA is
replicated until a ddNTP is added and the polymerase stops the
replication. After 35 cycles, a large number of fragments in all
different lengths are produced. These fragments are run in a specialized
acrylamide gel where their length and "end-base" are detected. Because
the fragments are seperated based on size in the gel, the bases are
detected one by one thus, producing the sequence. The purpose of
sequencing is for example, to predict the protein sequence of a gene, to
compare species on a sequence level (genes or genome), or to search for
a mutation.
