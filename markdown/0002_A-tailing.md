Once we have DNA with blunt ends from the
[End-repair](/wiki/End-repair "wikilink") step, we proceed by adding 1
nucleotide at the tail so that it can bind specifically with the adapter
that has the complimentary tail. Adenine (A) is added at the 3' end of
the DNA sample. As you remember, Adenine pairs up specifically with
Thymine. The adapters have Thymine at the 3' end that will specifically
bind to the 3' Adenine of the DNA sample.

A non-proof reading Polymerase such as *Taq* could be use to add an
Adenine at the 3' of the blunt end DNA.
