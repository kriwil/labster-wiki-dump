Nucleotides are the units on which [DNA](/wiki/DNA "wikilink") is built. They
are made up of a sugar molecule (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA), a
phosphate group, and a base. The sugar molecule is bound to both the
phosphate group and the base. Four types of nucleotides can be found in
DNA according to the which base that is bound to the sugar molecule. The
four bases are A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine) and G (guanine).
