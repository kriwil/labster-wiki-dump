Enzyme inhibition
-----------------

Enzyme inhibitors are molecules that decrease the activity of
[enzymes](/wiki/Enzyme "wikilink"), and knowledge about inhibitors can, for
example, be used in developing drugs or in the study of biochemical
pathways, because inhibitors provide a way to interfere with these
pathways. Enzyme inhibitors can be either irreversible or reversible;
irreversible inhibitors decrease enzymatic activity by destroying the
enzyme through various mechanisms, while reversible inhibitors keep the
enzyme functional. The inhibitors we will study here are reversible
inhibitors [1].

Types of inhibition
-------------------

The mechanisms of enzyme inhibitors can be classified into 3 major
groups: Competitive inhibitors, uncompetitive inhibitors , and mixed
inhibitors. Competitive inhibitors work by binding to the active site of
the enzyme in competition with the substrate; uncompetitive inhibitors
bind to the enzyme-substrate complex at a site distinct from the active
site, but they cannot bind to the enzyme alone; and mixed inhibitors can
bind to both the enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex at a site
distinct from the active site [1].

The mechanisms of enzyme inhibition can be thought of as an extension to
the [Michaelis-Menten mechanism](/wiki/Michaelis-Menten "wikilink") and
competitive and un-competitive inhibition can be regarded a special case
of mixed inhibition:

where K~I~ and K’~I~ are the dissociation constants of the EI and ESI
complex, respectively. Using the same approach as that used for deriving
the Michaelis-Menten equation (for a detailed derivation, see [2]), the
following equation for mixed inhibition can be obtained:

where

and

Just like the Michealis-Menten equation, this equation can be rearranged
to fit a double-reciprocal plot:

If α \> 1 and α’ \> 1, the inhibition is mixed; for competitive
inhibition, α’ = 1; for uncompetitive inhibition, α = 1. Thus, 3
different equations are obtained for the 3 different types of
inhibition, and a [Lineweaver-Burk](/wiki/km "wikilink") plot of the kinetic
data can reveal the type of inhibition that the inhibitor performs. This
will be explained in the following pages [1,2].

Methanol poisoning
------------------

The enzyme [alcohol dehydrogenase](/wiki/ADH "wikilink") is not completely
specific for ethanol; it also catalyzes the formation of aldehydes from
other alcohols. One of these alcohols is methanol, which is metabolized
into formaldehyde and other toxic compounds that can cause blindness or
death [3]. Methanol poisoning is quite common, and can be caused by the
ingestion of homemade alcohol. Methanol and ethanol are thus competitive
substrates, and ethanol is actually used to prevent poising after the
ingestion of methanol, because it inhibits ADH in catalyzing the
oxidation of this compound [4].

Calculation of kinetic parameters
---------------------------------

See the following pages for details of how to calculate the kinetic
parameters for different inhibitors:
