In accordance with the [Michaelis-Menten
equation](/wiki/Michaelis-Menten "wikilink"), the initial reaction rate (V~0~)
increases at increased substrate concentrations [S]. The reaction rate
increases more at lower substrate concentrations, and it eventually
reaches a plateau, approaching the maximum velocity V~max~ (Fig. 1). The
maximum initial velocity is reached when the enzyme is saturated, i.e.,
when enough substrate is present to ensure that practically all the
enzyme is part of the enzyme-substrate complex. Because the enzyme can
never be completely saturated, V~max~ is never fully reached. V~max~ is
dependent on 2 things: the [turnover number](/wiki/kcat "wikilink") of the
enzyme (k~cat~), and the concentration of the enzyme [E] [1].

Vmax = [E] • kcat

Thus, a higher [E] leads to a higher V~max~. The turnover number will be
described in more detail on the following page.

Determining V~max~
------------------

Just like [k~m~](/wiki/km "wikilink"), V~max~ can be determined using the
Lineweaver-Burk equation (Fig. 2):

Based on this equation, a straight line fitted to a double-reciprocal
plot will have the y-intercept 1/V~max~, and V~max~ can therefore be
obtained by taking the reciprocal to this intercept [1].
