A typical HPLC machine consists of several important components. These
components have their specific functions and they need each other in
order for us to run a successful HPLC experiment.

The main components of the HPLC are listed below:

-   **[Mobile phase reservoir](/wiki/Mobile_phase_reservoir "wikilink")** →
    This is where the mobile phase is contained. The mobile phase is
    normally stored in glass bottles.
-   **[Pumps](/wiki/Pumps "wikilink")** → The function of the pump is to
    create high pressure and create a flow of mobile phase in the
    system.
-   **[Sample injector](/wiki/Sample_injector "wikilink")** → This is where
    the sample in introduced in the system. The sample needs to be in
    liquid form (solution).
-   **[Column](/wiki/Column "wikilink")** → This is where the sample
    separation takes place. The column is filled with beads that is
    referred to as stationary phase.
-   **[Oven regulator](/wiki/Oven_regulator "wikilink")** → This is where the
    column is kept and the temperature can be controlled.
-   **[Detector](/wiki/Detector "wikilink")** → This is where the separated
    analytes are identified and quantified.
-   **Data acquisition** → Typically a computer is used where the data
    collected in the detector is processed, the data outcome can be
    presented as [Chromatogram](/wiki/Chromatogram "wikilink").

Starting the HPLC Machine
-------------------------

There are several steps that you need to do before you can run your HPLC
experiment. The major steps are outlined below:

-   **Sample preparation:**\

Only liquid samples can be introduced in the HPLC system. Therefore,
sample pre-treatment is required to clean-up interferences and/or
dissolve the analytes in a solvent. Three techniques are typically used
to remove interferences are extraction, filtration and centrifugation.

When the sample is solid, we need to process the sample from solid into
homogeneous solution. We can start by crushing the sample to make powder
by using a mortar and pestle. Then we can dissolve the powdered sample
into a solution. To eliminate clumps of sample that is not properly
dissolved, we can run the solution through a fine filter (typically a
0.5μm filter). Now we can be sure that our sample is a homogeneous
solution and ready to be injected into the HPLC machine.\

-   **Conditioning the system:**\

It is important to condition the column performing any analysis. This is
done by turning on the pump and selecting flow rate and temperature.
Then, you only need to wait until the pressure in the system is
constant. This means that the mobile phase has reached every pore of the
column, activating its beads, and the system is ready for the injection
of the sample. It will take some time for the mobile phase to activate
all the beads, in this time the flow rate and pressure is unstable.

It is very important to have exactly the same condition when you are
running several experiments and would like to compare them. This is why
conditioning the system is an important step. You will need to repeat
this step when you are measuring using another mobile or stationary
phase. When you are changing the mobile phase, you also need to flush
the tubing (connecting the mobile phase reservoir to the column) and
make sure that there is no remaining old mobile phase left.\

-   **Calibration curve:**\

![Calibration curve showing the sample concentrations in x axis and the area under the curve in y axis.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/labster/wiki/media/CalibrationCurve.png "fig:Calibration curve showing the sample concentrations in x axis and the area under the curve in y axis.")

In order to be able to determine the concentration of the analytes in
the sample, a calibration curve is needed. This is done by measuring
several solutions with known concentrations and inject them into the
system. You can then compare the known concentration with the resulting
chromatogram, the peak area also known as area under the curve is
proportional to the sample's concentration. The larger the area is, the
higher the concentration is. You can also observe the *retention time*
or the specific time it takes for the sample to travel through the
column and recorded at the detector. This *retention time* is compound
specific. When you are running a sample mixture that contains several
different compounds, you can then identify the compounds based on their
*retention time*.

The calibration curve is prepared by measuring several concentrations
creating a linear line. These concentrations have include concentration
that is both lower and higher than the expected concentration of the
analyte in the real sample. When you do not know the analyte
concentration in the real sample, typically you will prepare a
calibration curve using minimum 8 different sample concentrations. When
you know the expected analyte concentration in the real sample, you can
reduce the number of sample concentrations needed for the calibration
curve.
