Sterile technique refers to the actions of being "clean" in a lab
environment. When working in a lab, one encounters many sensitive
reagents, and any contamination or changes may affect your results
drastically. In scientific research it is crucial that every result is
dependable and more importantly: reproducable. If you cannot vouch for
every ingredient and their concentration in a reaction mix, you cannot
conclude anything based on those results. This is also the reason why
most tests and measurements are done in triplets (three identical
reaction tubes for each condition being tested). In that way, if similar
results are obtained from all three samples, there is a greater chance
that we can believe conclusions made from those results.
