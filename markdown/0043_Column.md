The column is a fundamental part of the HPLC system since it is where
the separation of the analytes takes place. The column is packed with
small beads made of silica that can be coated. It is the surface
material covering the beads that determine the polarity. Silica beads
are polar in their nature, but when coated with long carbon chains, they
become non polar. Because the beads inside the column are stationary
during the run, they are also referred to as the stationary phase.

In reverse phase, the stationary phase packed in the column is non
polar. Therefore, non polar analytes will interact with the column and
stay longer there, leaving the column later than polar compounds.\

Types of interactions
---------------------

![There are 4 types of interactions: non polar interactions, polar
interactions, ionic interactions and interactions based on the molecular
size.]( Types of interactions.png "There are 4 types of interactions: non polar interactions, polar interactions, ionic interactions and interactions based on the molecular size.")

The beads in columns are normally based on silica or a polymer.
Different chains can be attached to the structure, giving different
types of interactions:

-   **Interactions based on polarity:** polar compounds will be retained
    by stationary phases with polar chains, such as –CN or –OH. Non
    polar compounds will be retained by non polar groups in the
    stationary phase, such as –C8 or –C18.

-   **Ionic interactions:** depending on the pH, some groups can be
    protonated or deprotonated, forming ionic species. If the analyte
    and the stationary phase have opposite charges, the analytes will be
    retained in the column.

-   **Molecular size:** Small molecules can be retained in the pores of
    the stationary phase whereas large molecules will not get trapped.
    Therefore, small molecules will stay longer in the column whereas
    large molecules will pass faster.

Separation techniques
---------------------

Depending on the type of interactions present between analytes and
stationary phase, we can find two main HPLC techniques:

-   **Reverse Phase HPLC:** based on non polar interactions. Non polar
    compounds will move slower in the column than polar compounds.
-   **Normal Phase HPLC:** based on polar interactions. Polar compounds
    will move slower than non polar in the column.

Two other techniques are Ion Exchange Chromatography (based on ionic
interactions between analytes and resins positively or negatively
charged) and Size Exclusion Chromatography (based on the molecular size
of analytes).

Polarity scale
--------------

The polarity of a molecule can be compared to another molecule's
polarity. One molecule can be more polar when compered to another
molecule, but it can also be less polar when compared to a different
molecule. One can say that polarity has its own scale. For example, CN
is more polar than C8 but less polar than Silica.
