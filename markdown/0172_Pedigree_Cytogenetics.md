represented by a symbol: circle (female) or square (male), which is

individuals. Matings are illustrated by a connecting horizontal mating
line, their offspring is depicted beneath a vertical offspring line, and
sips are attached to a horizontal sip ship line. Each generation is
assigned a roman numeral (I, II, III, and others) and each individual of
a generation is assigned an arabic numeral (1, 2, 3, and others).
