Chemical and physical agents that can cause DNA damage include ionizing
radiation, ultraviolet light, alkylating agents, hydrogen ions, and
hydroxy radicals.

UV-induced DNA damage and repair
--------------------------------

**DNA damage**

The
purine and pyrimidine bases of nucleic acids absorb UV radiation
strongly. UV light can be classified into three groups based on the
wavelength: UV-A (315-400nm), UV-B (280-315nm) and UV-C (280 nm). UV
light with longer wavelength (UV-A and UV-B) affects DNA significantly.
Besides UV, other exogenous factors such ionizing radiation and
endogenous factors such as free radicals are known to interfere with
genome integrity. DNA damage leads to several events:\
\*Bases misincorporation

-   Deamination, depurination, and depyrimidination of bases
-   Oxidative damage
-   Alkylation of bases
-   Single or double-strand breaks

However, the major classes of mutagenic DNA lesions induced by UV
radiation are cyclobutane–pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6–4 photoproducts
(6–4PPs). These dimers and photoproducts lead to replication arrests and
double-strand breaks. Among several types of DNA damage, double-strand
breaks are the most dangerous because they affect both DNA strands and
can lead to the loss of genetic material.

**DNA repair**

![Homologous recombination](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/labster/wiki/media/homologous recombination.png "fig:Homologous recombination")

Double-strand DNA breaks can be repaired by two main pathways:
homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining. In simple
eukaryotes such as yeast, homologous recombination is the main pathway,
whereas in higher eukaryotes such as mammals, non-homologous end-joining
become the main pathway.

Homologous recombination involves several protein such as Rad52 protein,
MRE11-Rad50-NSB1 complex, and Rad51. Homologous recombination involves
relationship between damaged DNA and undamaged DNA molecule with which
it share sequence homologies. This undamaged DNA molecule is used as a
template for DNA repair. Steps in homologous recombination are as
follows:\
\*Nucleotide restriction of the damage DNA by MRE11-Rad50-NSB1 complex.

-   Binding of 3'-single-stranded DNA by heptameric ring complex that is
    formed by Rad52 protein
-   Interaction between Rad51 and Rad52 stimulating the DNA strand
    exchange activity of Rad51.
-   Rad51 protein catalyzes the strand exchange between damage DNA and
    template DNA, displacing one strand as D-loop.
-   Polymerase filling the gap of DNA double-strand breaks.
-   The resulting structure are resolved by Holiday junction.

Rad52
-----

Rad52 protein in *Sacchromyces cerevisae* plays an important role in
double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. Rad52 forms
heptameric ring that catalyses DNA annealing and mediates Rad51-mediated
strand invasion. Rad52 protein also protect 3' single-stranded DNA from
exonucleolytic digestion in homologous recombination process.
