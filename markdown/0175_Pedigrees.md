A pedigree is a diagram depicting members of a family, their
inter-relatedness and their disease/phenotypic status. A pedigree is
made to give an overview of the inheritance pattern and frequency of a
(suspected) hereditary trait. Each family member is represented by a
symbol: circle (female) or square (male), which is filled/black for
affected individuals and empty/white for normal individuals. Matings are
illustrated by a connecting horizontal mating line, their offspring is
depicted beneath a vertical offspring line and sips are attached to a
horizontal sip ship line. Each generation is assigned a roman numeral
(I, II, III etc.) and each individual of a generation is assigned an
arabic numeral (1, 2, 3, 4 etc.).
