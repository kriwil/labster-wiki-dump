Welcome to the Plant Evolution and Genetics Lab!

In this lab you will learn about the most important prehistoric events
in plant evolution and plant metabolism. You will extract a secondary
metabolite that kills a malaria parasite. You will also transform the
genes necessary for the secondary metabolite synthesis into a moss; this
will allow you to produce large quantities of a new antimalarial drug
and save thousands of lives.

You can find all of the related theory needed to complete the case from
this Wiki page.

Good luck!
