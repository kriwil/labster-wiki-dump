Reporter gene is a gene with a distinct characteristic when expressed.
Because of this distinct characteristic that is easily identified and
measured, this reporter gene can be used to monitor the expression of a
certain gene.

Green Fluorescent Protein
-------------------------

![Green fluorescent protein

In this case, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from jelly fish
*(Aequorea victoria)* was used as a reporter gene because it emits
bright green light (λ = 509 nm) when excited with UV or blue light (λ
max = 395 nm, minor 475 = nm). Violet/blue light causes a reaction of
decarboxylation of Glu22, which helps the formation of anionic
fluorescent form of the chromophore. When the gene of interest (GOI) is
expressed, GFP will also be expressed resulting in a bright green
cell/colony. But if GOI is not expressed, the cells and colonies will
not emit the bright green light.

In *Aequorea victoria*, the protein responsible for bioluminescence
capability is the Aequorin protein. This protein will emit blue light
upon binding with Ca^2+^ ions. The blue light is then absorbed by GFP,
which converts it into the green light.

Tet-On and Off System
---------------------

Gene expression can be controlled using a regulator gene. A regulator
gene can regulate the gene expression by expressing certain protein or
miRNA that blocks or actives the gene transcription process. One of the
commonly used regulator gene is Tet-off and Tet-on system that utilizes
tetracycline (Tc) or doxycycline (Dox,a Tc derivative) as the switch
control. In the **Tet-off** system, the gene expression is turned
**off** when Tc or Dox is present in the medium, whereas in the
**Tet-on** system, the gene expression is turned **on** when Dox is
present. The Tet-on system is responsive only to Dox, and not to Tc. In
this case, expression of GOI is being controlled by Tet-off system.

Important components of Tet-off system are:\
\* **Regulatory protein**\
Regulatory protein that is involved in Tet-off system is a
tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) that acts as activator. In
this case, the yeast used are stable cell line that contain a Tet-off
regulator plasmid which encodes for protein tTA.

-   **Response plasmid**\

Response plasmid expresses a gene of interest (In this case, RAD52-eGFP)
under the control of the tetracycline-response element, or TRE.
Important elements in the response plasmid are TRE, promoter and GOI.
TRE acts as an operator that controls the transcription of GOI. GOI is
only expressed when tTA binds TRE and activates GOI transcription under
condition where Tc or Dox is not present. Tc or Dox can bind to tTA
making it unable to bind to TRE, causing GOI not to be expressed.

Transilluminator
----------------

Transilluminator is commonly used for fluorescent marker visualization.
Transilluminator parts are UV, blue light source and supporting
electronics that are placed in a box with appropriate optical filters. A
transilluminator must be used carefully because it emits ultraviolet
radiation (commonly between 302 nm and 365 nm) that can cause damage to
human tissue in the eyes and skin.
