DNA is the hereditary material of all living organisms, including
humans. DNA stores information through a code made up of four chemical
bases: A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine), and it
is the order (or sequence) of these four bases that determine the
information given by the DNA. The information is used as instructions
for building and maintaining all the cells of an organism. The human
genome consists of around 3.2 billion base pairs.

**How to collect a DNA sample**

The DNA is stored in the nucleus of each cell. This means, that DNA can
be harvested from any sample containing eukaryotic cells. Usually a
blood sample is collected and the DNA is then extracted from the white
blood cells (red blood cells do not contain a nucleus). If blood
sampling is impossible or too risky (children, animals, forensics),
smaller amounts of DNA can also be extracted from a mouth swap (contains
epithelial cells) or a few hairs with bulp.

![DNA is organized in a double-helix form. It is said to be
antiparallel, because one strand runs in the 5'-\>3' direction and the
other in the 3'-\>5'
