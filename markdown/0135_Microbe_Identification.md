Identification of unknown microbe species is important in various
applications, such as disease diagnosis and infection treatment in the
health industry, criminal investigation, environmental studies or
inoculum preparation in the wine and brewing industry. Microbe
identification can be performed with several methods, as follows:
 ![ Colony morphology identification. Each microorganism has a distinct characteristic when grown on certain media agar in Petri dish.]( Colony morphology.jpg "fig: Colony morphology identification. Each microorganism has a distinct characteristic when grown on certain media agar in Petri dish.")

![Bacteria shape can be identified under the microscope.]( Bacteria shape.png "Bacteria shape can be identified under the microscope.")

### Morphology identification

In morphology identification, gross and microscopic morphology are
examined to determine the species of the microbe of interest. Gross
morphology includes colony shape, size, color and surface features.
Using a microscope, one can also determine the shape of the
microorganisms. But the, morphology identification method exhibits some
drawbacks, since it can be used only for organisms that can be
cultivated *in vitro*.\
\**Saccharomyces cerevisiae*\
Colony morphology on Sabouraud dextrose agar: cream colored and smooth.\
Microscopic morphology: large, globose to ellipsoidal budding yeast-like
cells.\
\**Lactobacillus*\
Colony morphology:Circular form and entire margin.\
Microscopic morphology:Gram positive rod.\

### Biochemical tests

Morphology identification has some limitations, making it less specific.
Closely related organisms can be differentiated using a series of
biochemical tests that identify various metabolic properties of
different bacterial species. Biochemical tests that have been used to
identify bacteria as follows:

  Biochemical Test         Function

  Motility                 Identifies the bacteria's ability to move (flagellated cell)
                           

  Oxidase                  Demonstrates the bacteria's ability to produce cytochrome-c oxidase, hence the capability of reducing oxygen
                           

  Glucose Fermentation     Determines the ability of a bacterium to ferment the sugar glucose, and to convert pyruvic acid into gaseous by products.
                           

  Nitrate                  Determines the ability of a bacterium to produce the enzyme nitratase, hence its capability of converting nitrate into nitrite
                           

  Fluid Thioglycollate     Shows oxygen usage
                           

  Urea                     Determines the ability of a bacterium to produce the enzyme urease, hence its capability of hydrolyzing urea.
                           

  Tryptone broth/ Indole   Determines the ability of a bacterium to produce the enzyme tryptophanase.
                           

  MR-Methyl Red            Indicator of low pH. Determines the fermentation ability of bacteria.
                           

  VP- Voges Proskauer      Determines the ability of a bacterium to produce acetoin.
                           

  Simmons citrate slant    Demonstrates the ability of Gram-negative bacteria to use citrate as an energy source.

### Molecular Methods

The classical methods of microbe identification are relatively
laborious. Identification using the molecular method has greatly
improved the speed and specificity of the identification process. In
this method, nucleic acid sequences (DNA and RNA) from unknown species
and known species (from a database) are compared to determine their
similarities. Basically, there are two types of identification using the
molecular method:\
\* Genotypic methods\
This methods involves extraction of genomic DNA from an unknown microbe
species, which is further analysed with Southern blot, Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), or Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP).\
\* Protein-based methods\
This method includes Western blot, Immuno-precipitation and Enzyme
Linked Immuno-sorbant Assay (ELISA), which use antibodies to detect
specific proteins that are unique to an organism.
