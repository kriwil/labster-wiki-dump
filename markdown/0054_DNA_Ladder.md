A DNA Ladder is a mix of DNA fragments with known lengths. It is used as
a scale for determining the lengths of unknown DNA fragments. The size
of the fragments is determined is by running a gel with the DNA ladder
in a well next to the samples with unknown lengths. The bands showing
from the DNA ladder have predetermined lengths such as "100 bp", "500
bp" and others. If a band from an unknown sample has run the same
distance in the gel as the 500 bp band, it can be assumed that the
unknown fragment has a length close or equal to 500.
