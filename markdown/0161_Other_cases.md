Crime Scene Investigation
=========================

In the CSI case, you are the scientist responsible for catching the
person responsible for the murder of a professor. After collecting
evidence at the crime scene, you perform PCR and Gel Electrophoresis in
the lab to create DNA profiles. The DNA profiles of the suspects are
compared to the evidence found at the crime scene. Can you find and
convict the murderer?
