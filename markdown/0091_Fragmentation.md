One of the limitations of the Next Generation Sequencing is the length
of DNA sample that it can sequence. Current Illumina technology can
sequence up to 250 bp. Our genome is a lot longer than that, for
example, the longest chromosome, which is chromosome 1 is almost 250
million bp. Therfore, in the sample preparation of NGS, the DNA needs to
be fragmented or cut into a smaller size. This step is typically
referred to as the *fragmentation* step.

Shorter DNA samples, for example, [ancient DNA
sample](/wiki/ancient_DNA_sample "wikilink") do not need to be fragmented
because they are already partially degraded into approximately 50 bp.
Another example is cDNA generated from miRNA (micro RNA), which is also
very short.

There are 2 ways to fragment the DNA
------------------------------------

-   **Sonication**:

In sonication, the DNA is fragmented by exposing it to sound wave
(usually ultrasound). When a powerful sound wave hits the DNA strand it
will create double strand breaks cutting the long DNA strand into
smaller DNA strands. To get a specific DNA size, power and the time need
to be adjusted.

-   **Enzymatic**:

Long DNA strands can also be fragmented using enzymatic reactions. There
are several different enzymes that are capable of cutting DNA strands;
they can target specific sequences or randomly cut the DNA.
