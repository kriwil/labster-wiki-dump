Fragmented DNA (either artificially fragmented or partially degraded)
typically have sticky ends, implying that 1 of the strand is longer than
the other strand (see Figure 1) DNA with sticky ends will ligate easily
to other DNA that has complementary sticky ends. To prevent DNA with
these sticky ends to pair with another DNA, we need to modify them into
DNA with blunt ends (see Figure 1). One of the steps in the NGS sample
preparation is to repair these sticky ends and create DNA with blunt
ends. This is important for the next step,
[A-tailing](A-tailing "wikilink").

End-repair enzymes
------------------

Two enzymes are typically used for repairing DNA with sticky ends (see
Figure 2)

-   **Polymerase**: Polymerase fills in the missing bases for the strand
    from 5' to 3' direction. The resulting double strand DNA will be the
    same length as the original longest DNA strand.
-   **Exonuclease**: Exonuclease removes the 3' overhangs. The resulting
    double strand DNA will be the same length as the original shortest
    DNA strand.

overhangs.]( Endrepairs.jpg "Figure 2. The Polymerase adding nucleotides in the 5' → 3' direction and the exonuclease removing nucleotides at the 3' overhangs.")
