### Separation

Terpenoids can be extracted from plant material by solvent extraction.
Due to the non-polar nature of terpenoids an organic solvent such as
chloroform should be used. The dissolved molecules can be further
purified by simple techniques such as liquid-liquid partitioning with a
polar solvent such as water. The dissolved molecules can then be
separated by Liquid Chromatography (LC) using a silica gel column. Thus
polar molecules interact with the silica beads which leads to a
prolonged retention time. Apolar molecules like terpenoids move faster
through the column. By optimizing solvent strength, mobile phase
composition, pH, gradient and temperature the different molecules elute
at different retention times and can be separated.

### Characterization

Each purified component can then be characterized by mass spectrometry
(MS). The mass spectrometer accelerates the molecules and ionizes them
to produce charged molecular fragments. With a strong magnetic field the
accelerated ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio.
Depending on the chemical structure of the molecule each molecule breaks
into different fragments. Therefore each component produces a mass
specturm with a unique fragmentation pattern. This molecular fingerprint
can be compared to a database and the component can be identified.
