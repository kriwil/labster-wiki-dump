Many industrial products are produced by fermentations

-   MIcrobial cells(biomass)production, eg. bakers yeast.
-   Microbial metabolites production, eg. ethanol.
-   Microbial enzymes, eg. hydrolases
-   Recombinant products production, eg. human insulin produced in
    yeast.

There are several types of fermentations. The most important are Batch,
Fedbatch and Chemostat.

### Batch Fermentation

In the fermentation case we used batch fermentation to produce
bioethanol. In batch fermentation nothing else is put or taken out until
the reaction is done. In batch fermentation, there is no nutrients
addition during fermentation so exponential growth of cell is limited to
a few generations.

fermentation](Growth curve.png "Yeast growth phase in batch fermentation")

The phase of microbial growth in batch fermentation is generally divided
into four phase which are lag phase, log phase or exponential phase and
stationary phase. In lag phase, microbes are growing and adapting to new
environment so the biomass is not increasing significantly. During the
log phase, nutrient consumption is in maximum state hence maximum
biomass is achieved. Since it is a batch fermentation where no
additional nutrients was added, nutrient will be depleted and growth
rate decrease and becomes zero.
