Electron transport is a membrane-mediated process leading to the
transfer of electrons from the substrate to O~2~. Electron transport
chain is formed by a carrier compound embedded in the inner membrane of
mitochondria of yeast. Two basic functions of electron transport chain
are as follows:

-   Facilitating the transfer of electrons from the primary donor to
    terminal acceptor
-   Conserving energy that been released during electron transfer for
    ATP synthesis

Several oxidative-reductive enzymes such as NADH dehydrogenases,
flavoprotein, iron-sulfur protein, and cytochromes participate in
electron transfer. Also, non-protein electron carriers, called guinones,
are involved in electron transfer.

In the electron transport process, the hydrogen ion (H^+^) originates
from NADH, FADH, and dissociation of water in the cytoplasm are extruded
to the outer surface of the membrane. The extrusion of H^+^ to the outer
membrane results in the accumulation of OH^-^ inside the membrane. This
separation of H^+^ and OH^-^ results in pH and charge differentiation
between both sides. This pH and charge gradient between two sides of the
membrane is called proton motive force and makes the membrane charged
like a battery. H^+^ moves back into the membrane through a pore created
by ATP synthase, allowing the enzyme to prepare ATP at the expense of
this gradient.
