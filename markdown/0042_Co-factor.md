Some enzymes require "helper-molecules" for catalysis to take place.
These helper-molecules are called cofactors. Cofactors are non-protein
molecules that bind to the enzyme and contribute to reactions in a
number of different ways. Co-factors can either be inorganic ions, such
as the Zn^2+^ ions required by [ADH](/wiki/ADH "wikilink"), or they can be
more complex organic or metalloorganic molecules, which are then called
co-enzymes. If a co-factor is bound tightly (sometimes covalently) to
the enzyme, it is termed a prosthetic group [1].

Co-factor for alcohol dehydrogenase
-----------------------------------

The enzyme ADH from this case requires the co-enzyme Nicotinamide
Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD^+^) in order to function. This co-enzyme takes
up a hydride ion (H^-^) from the ethanol, leading to the formation of an
acetaldehyde. NAD^+^ is reduced to NADH and thereby works as an electron
acceptor. Most co-enzymes are derived from vitamins, and NAD^+^ is
derived from the vitamin niacin. Without NAD^+^, ADH would not function.
The chemical structure of NAD^+^ and the manner in which reduction takes
place is shown in Fig. 1 [1].
