In a genome scan your aim is to identify DNA markers that are linked to
an inherited trait in which the involved gene is unknown. By identifying
the linked markers you narrow down the chromosomal region and can focus
your search for the involved gene to a fraction of the genome.

In a genome scan you genotype DNA markers covering the entire genome and
perform linkage analysis to identify DNA markers that co-segregate with
the inherited trait.
