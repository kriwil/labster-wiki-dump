The product is, as the name states, the output of a reaction. For the
reaction catalyzed by ADH, the product is acetaldehyde. ADH oxidizes
ethanol into acetaldehyde by removing 2 H^+^ ions and 2 electrons. The
chemical structure of acetaldehyde can be seen in the figures to the
right.

Most people think that ethanol is the only compound responsible for the
feeling of being drunk; however, it has been indicated that many effects
associated with alcohol consumption may be caused be increased levels of
acetaldehyde, the product of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by ADH
[1]. The accumulation of acetaldehyde is also the cause of the symptoms
of the [ADH|Asian glow syndrome].
