A mixed inhibitor interacts with the enzyme alone and with the
enzyme-substrate complex. The double-reciprocal equation for mixed
inhibition is as follows, as already mentioned [1]:

where
![]( inhibition alpha.png "fig: inhibition alpha.png")
and
![]( inhibition alpha'.png "fig: inhibition alpha'.png")

For mixed inhibition, the Lineweaver-Burk plots show both different
slopes and different y-intersects at different inhibitor concentrations.
To calculate the parameters in this case, 2 new plots must be prepare:
first, plot the intercepts against the inhibitor concentrations; this
makes it possible to obtain K’~I~ and V~max~, as described under
un-competitive inhibition. Second, plot the slopes against the inhibitor
concentrations; form this, K~I~ can be found. The slope of this plot is
k~m~ / V~max~, therefore multiplying this slope with V~max~ already
obtained gives K~m~.

Non-competitive inhibition
--------------------------

In the special case of mixed inhibition where α = α', i.e., K~I~ = K'~I~
, the type of inhibition is called *non-competitive inhibition*. In this
special case, the inhibitor interacts in a favorable manner with the
enzyme-substrate complex as it does with the enzyme alone. When plotting
kinetic data in a Lineweaver-Burk plot, a **common x-intersect** shows
that the competitor is non-competitive [1,2].

The double-reciprocal equation for noncompetitive inhibition is thus as
follows:

![]( double reciprocal non-competitive inhibition equation.png "fig: double reciprocal non-competitive inhibition equation.png")
where
![]( inhibition alpha.png "fig: inhibition alpha.png")

When plotting kinetic data using a non-competitive inhibitor, the
apparent K~m~ remains the same as the actual K~m~, and it can be
calculated from a Lineweaver-Burk plot in by dividing the slope with the
y-intersect [1]. To calculate V~max~ and K~I~, the y-intersects of the
different lines obtained from linear regression of Lineweaver-Burk plots
at different inhibitor concentrations must be plotted against the
inhibitor concentration. When fitted using linear regression, V~max~ and
K~I~ can be calculated from this plot in the same manner as that in the
case of un-competitive inhibition: V~max~ is calculated by taking the
reciprocal to the y-intersect of this line, and K~I~ is calculated by
dividing the y-intersect with the slope.

Steps of calculating the kinetic parameters when using a non-competitive inhibitor
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Prepare Lineweaver-Burk plots of the kinetic data and fit the data
    using linear regression (1 fit per inhibitor concentration).
-   Calculate K~m~ by dividing the slope of any of these lines with the
    corresponding y-intersect (K~m~ obtained should not depend on the
    line used).
-   Plot the y-intersects of each of these fits as a function of the
    inhibitor concentration.
-   To calculate V~max~, take the reciprocal of the y-intersect of this
    plot.
-   To calculate K~I~, divide the y-intersect of this plot with the
    slope.
