When a gene is expressed, it is first transcribed (DNA -\> mRNA) and the
mRNA is then translated into a protein. Not all genes in the genome are
expressed in all cells/tissues as the need and function of various
cells/tissues differ. Therefore the consequences of a gene mutation will
primarily affect tissues relying on and expressing that specific gene.
Techniques for detecting gene expression are for example northern blot,
quantitative PCR and microarray.
