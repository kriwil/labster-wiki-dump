The Michaelis constant, K~m~, is a parameter in the [Michaelis-Menten
equation](Michaelis-Menten "wikilink"). K~m~ is equal to the substrate
concentration where the corresponding reaction rate is ½ • V~max~
(Fig.1). An enzyme with a low K~m~ therefore achieves its [half-maximal
velocity](vmax "wikilink") at a low substrate concentration, while an
enzyme with a high K~m~ needs high substrate concentrations to achieve
this velocity. It has been experimentally shown, that K~m~ of an enzyme
is usually close to the cellular concentration of its substrate. For an
enzymatic reaction involving 2 steps, where the second step is rate
limiting, K~m~ is approximately equal to the dissociation constant of
the ES complex. In this case, a low K~m~ implies a high affinity for the
substrate; however this interpretation of K~m~ is only valid for a few
enzymes [1].

The Lineweaver-Burk equation
----------------------------

Several methods for determining Km exist. The most direct method is to
plot V~0~ against [S] and use curve fitting software to fit the
Michaelis-Menten equation directly. However, certain transformations
allow determination via linear regression, and these transformations are
also useful when analyzing enzyme inhibition. Several transformations
are possible; however, a simple one is obtained by taking the reciprocal
on both sides of the Michaelis-Menten equation. This leads to the
following expression, called the Lineweaver-Burk equation:

This equation shows, that a plot of 1/V~0~ against 1/[S] should give a
plot that can be fitted by a straight line with the y-intercept 1/V~max~
and slope K~m~/V~max~. Thus, K~m~ can be obtained using linear
regression. Fig. 2. shows an illustration of how to interpret the slope
and intersects on a Lineweaver-Burk plot. [1]

Other transformations
---------------------

Notable, the Lineweaver-Burk transformation is not the only option. For
example, a plot of [S]/V~0~ against [S] (a Hanes–Woolf plot) will also
result in a straight line [2]. However, in this case, we will use the
Lineweaver-Burk transformation:
