STR (Short Tandem Repeat) markers are polymorphic sequences found evenly
spaced in mammalian genomes. The core repeats can be di- (e.g., CA) tri-
(e.g., CAG) or tetra-nucleotides (e.g., ATGC) and these core sequences
are repeated a number of times after each other (e.g., CACACACACACA or
(CA)6). Variation in the number of repeats forms the basis of different
alleles in the individual STR loci. In the population multiple alleles
can be present (e.g., five different alleles), but in an individual
(diploid), there is a maximum of two different alleles (one on each
homologous chromosome).

The STR-loci are flanked by unique sequences, and therefore the
individual STR-loci can be amplified by PCR and the sizes of the alleles
in each individual can be estimated by gel electrophoresis. In this
manner genotyping of the individual markers can be performed.
