Sterilization refers to the removal of all microorganisms in a material
or on an object. Sterilization ensure that even fungal spores or highly
resistant bacterial endospores are killed.

Bioreactors can be sterilized with or without the medium. Bioreactors
are normally sterilized by heating the jacket or coil of the bioreactor
using steam in the vessel. For sterilization, steam pressure inside the
vessel is 15 psi and held for 20 min. After sterilization complete, it
is important to maintain positive pressure inside the vessel; otherwise,
a vacuum may develop and unsterile air be drawn into the vessel.

### Aseptic Technique

When using a bioreactor, working with pure culture is always desirable.
Due to the ubiquity of microorganisms, unwanted organisms known as
contaminants can contaminate and make the fermentation unsuccessful. An
aseptic method, which prevents the introduction of unwanted organisms
into a workspace, must be applied during fermentation.

Key to work sterile is as follows:

-   Laboratory doors and windows are kept closed to prevent air
    currents, which can cause microorganisms, from the surface to become
    airborne.
-   Wire loop and glass spreader are sterilized before and after use
    with the Bunsen burner to prevent introduction of unwanted
    microorganism.
-   Lids from the bottle and tube are held when removed and not placed
    on the bench during material transfer from one bottle/ tube to the
    other.
-   The neck of a bottle or tube must be immediately heated using the
    Bunsen burner so that any air movement is outward.
-   The bottle or tube must be open for the minimum time, and while it
    is open, all work must be done close to the Bunsen burner flame.
-   Media and fermenter have to be sterilized to prevent the growth of
    unwanted microorganisms.

### Media Sterilization

The medium and its container must be sterilized by autoclaving before
use to avoid contamination. The autoclave utilizes high-pressure
saturated steam at 121o C for 15 to 20 minutes to kill the
microorganisms on the medium and its container. To ensure that the
autoclave procedure has been conducted, an autoclave tape is labeled on
the bottle that contains the medium. The autoclave tape has a white
stripe which will turn black if subjected to high-temperature steam.
Therefore, we can identify whether a bottle of medium has been
autoclaved/sterilized or not by looking at the stripe color of the
autoclave tape.

### Inoculum preparation

Aseptic inoculum transfer:\
(a) Turn on the Bunsen burner.\
(b) Heat the media bottle opening.\
(c) Take media using the pipette, and add to a test tube.\
(d) Reheat the media bottle opening.\
(e) Close the media bottle.\
(f) Sterilize the wire loop with Bunsen burner flame (A sterile pipette
tip can also be used instead of a wire loop, and it does not need to be
heated.)\
(g) Take the culture with the wire loop and add to the test tube.\

To calculate how much inoculum is required to be added to the fermenter,
one can use the formula below: V~1~ is the volume taken from the
inoculum, C~1~ is the concentration in the inoculum, V~2~ is the final
volume in the fermenter and C~2~ is the concentration wanted in the
fermenter.\

Culture used to inoculate (inoculum) for fermentation meet the following
criteria:

-   Healthy and in active state to minimize lag phase time
-   Free of contamination
-   Suitable morphological form
-   Available in sufficient volume
-   Retain its product-forming capabilities

Before the culture can be used as inoculum for a large scale
fermentation, it must go through several preparation steps:

-   Inoculum preservation
-   Inoculum build-up/ activation: 1-2 shake flask cultures
-   Prefermenter : 1-3 prefermenter cultures
-   Production fermenter

Culture that has satisfied all criteria for a good inoculum must be
transferred to shake flasks for culture activation. Before it can be
used in a production fermenter, the activated inoculum must be gradually
upscaled in prefermenters. After all steps are done without
contamination, the inoculum is ready to be used in a production
fermenter.
