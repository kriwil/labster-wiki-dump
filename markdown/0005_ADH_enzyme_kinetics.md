Welcome to Labster's enzyme kinetics case!

In the enzyme kinetics case you will learn about the enzyme alcohol
dehydrogenase and how to perform the enzyme kinetics experiment as well
as learn about a condition caused by the improper functioning of alcohol
dehydrogenase.

You will be able to find all the related theory required to complete the
case from this Wiki page.

Good luck!
