In Crime movies and CSI TV-series, science and biotechnology are shown
as essential parts of solving a murder. But how does this really work?
How is evidence processed in real life laboratories, and how are
experimental data used to convict a murderer?

Often at crime scenes, evidence containing human biological material is
collected. This could be blood, hair, or semen. If such a sample has
been collected, it is crucial to determine whether it is from the victim
or someone else; if the sample is not from the victim, it is most
probably from the individual person who committed the crime. But how is
it determined who the sample comes from?

In the Labster CSI case, it is your mission to use DNA profiling to try
and to solve a brutal murder of a Professor!

But first, learn how to perform DNA fingerprinting as a professional
scientist.
