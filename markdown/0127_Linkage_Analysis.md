In linkage analysis you identify loci that co-segregate in a pedigree.
You can perform linkage analysis using two traits (like in early fruit
fly experiments) or you can perform linkage analysis between DNA markers
(e.g., STR markers) and a locus involved in an inherited disease. Today,
linkage analysis is typically performed to identify a candidate region
and thereby focus the search for a candidate gene to a limited
chromosomal region.
