![ Extraction of DNA, RNA and protein.]( Trizol.png "fig: Extraction of DNA, RNA and protein.") In
order to retrieve the RNA molecules from plant cells, the cell walls
must be cracked and plasma membranes lysed. Every organism encodes for
RNAses, an enzyme family that degrades RNA molecules. It is important to
be very careful when working with RNA because of the abundance of RNAses
in the environment. Any grain of dust can contain RNAses, which can
degrade the RNAs in your sample. Therefore, the cells are usually ground
in liquid nitrogen with a temperature of -196°C. Liquid nitrogen boils
at -196°C; at this low temperature the enzymes are inactivated and all
biological functions stop. In addition, the low temperatures render the
cell walls brittle which makes them very fragile and breakable.\
A common method used to isolate total RNA is guanidium
thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction. This method utilizes a
chemical called TRI reagent. The TRI reagent maintains the RNAs
integrity, disrupts cells and denatures proteins.\
 The main steps of RNA isolation are as follows:\
\*Cell lysis and disruption of cellular structures.\
\*Separate RNA from cell debris.\
\*RNA is purified.\
\
Once the macromolecules are in a solution they can be separated from the
cell debris by centrifugation. Phase separation of the sample will occur
when chloroform is added to the monophasic TRI reagent. The polar RNA
will remain in the upper polar phase, DNA will accumulate in the
interphase and the denatured proteins will dissolve in the lower organic
phase. The RNA is recovered by adding isopropanol, which precipitates
polar molecules like RNAs and salts. The salts can be washed away with
75% ethanol to obtain pure RNA.
