When a gene is expressed, it is first transcribed (DNA → mRNA) and the
mRNA is then translated into a protein. Not all genes in the genome are
expressed in all cells/tissues because the need and function of various
cells/tissues differ. Therefore, the consequences of a gene mutation
will primarily affect tissues relying on and expressing that specific
gene. Techniques for detecting gene expression are for example, northern
blot, quantitative PCR, and microarray.
