Welcome to Labster's Molecular Cloning case

Here, you will learn about the molecular cloning techniques including
how to prepare the DNA insert and vector, and how to perform restriction
enzyme digestion and ligation followed by transformation, plating, and
antibiotic selection. Finally you will perform a DNA damage experiment
using UV radiation and find out whether *RAD52* is required for DNA
repair.

You will be able to find all the related theory in this Wiki page needed
for completing the case.

Good luck!
