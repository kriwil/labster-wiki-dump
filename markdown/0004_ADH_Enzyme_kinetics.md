Welcome to Labster's Enzyme Kinetics case!

In the Enzyme Kinetics case you will learn about enzyme Alcohol
Dehydrogenase, how to perform enzyme kinetics experiment as well as
learning about a condition that is caused by the enzyme Alcohol
Dehydrogenase not functioning properly.

You will be able to find all the related theory needed to complete the
case from this Wiki page.

Good luck!
