The Michaelis-Menten equations, as you have seen in the previous
section, describe the rate of a 1-substrate enzyme-catalyzed reaction.
The parameters *V~max~* and *K~m~* can be obtained experimentally for
any given enzyme; however, they themselves provide very little
information about the reaction mechanism, such as the number of discrete
steps and their individual reaction rates. The reaction rate (V) is
defined as the change in concentration over time. The rate can be
expressed as either the rate of formation of products (P), or as the
rate of consumption of reactants (the substrate, S) [1].

Note that the rate of consumption of the substrate is equal to the
negative change in the concentration of the substrate over time. The
Michaelis-Menten equation described on the previous page is based on the
following reaction mechanism:

This mechanism includes 3 individual reactions with three different rate
constants:

-   E + S → ES, formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, with the rate
    constant k~1~

-   ES → E + S, dissociation of the enzyme and the substrate, with the
    rate constant k~-1~

-   ES → E + P, dissociation of the enzyme and the product, with the
    rate constant k~2~

In the Michaelis-Menten model it is assumed that the third reaction is
the rate-limiting step, and the associated rate constant k~2~ is also
called the [turnover number](/wiki/kcat "wikilink") or k~cat~. For another
reaction mechanism, the turnover number would be defined differently,
for instance, in the following reaction:

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/labster/wiki/media/Fig3.jpg " Fig3.jpg")

where the last step is the rate-limiting step. Here, k~cat~ is equal to
the rate constant of this step, i.e., k~cat~ = k~3~. For reactions with
more complicated reaction mechanisms, k~cat~ can be a function of
several rate constants. [2]

Initial reaction rate
---------------------

![Fig. 1. Progress curve of a general enzymatic reaction.  ](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/labster/wiki/media/Progress curve.png "fig:Fig. 1. Progress curve of a general enzymatic reaction. ")
During the course of the reaction, [S] decreases and [P] increases. This
results in an overall decrease in the reaction rate, as illustrated in
Fig. 1. To measure the reaction rate of an enzymatic reaction
corresponding to a specific substrate concentration, it is therefore
necessary to measure the reaction rate in the beginning of the reaction.
In the beginning of the reaction, the substrate concentration can be
assumed to be constant, and the progress curve is close to linear. Thus,
the rate of the reaction, which is equal to the slope of the progress
curve, can be obtained using linear regression. The reaction rate in the
beginning of the reaction is called the initial reaction rate or V~0~
[1].
