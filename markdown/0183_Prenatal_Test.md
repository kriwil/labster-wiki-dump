Typical prenatal test available for expecting parents are as follows:\
 **Prenatal Screening Test**\
Identify baby's possible increased risk of having a particular problem.
Screening test cannot tell if the baby definitely has a problem but may
indicate that further testing needs to be considered.\
Prenatal screening test includes nuchal (perform during gestational week
11 to 14), ultrasound examination (perform during gestational week 18 to
20) and maternal serum testing.\

**Prenatal Diagnosis Test**\
Identify baby's problem/abnormality, for example by using DNA analysis
or karyotyping. Even though the prenatal diagnosis is normal, the baby
could suffer from other problem. At this point, we don’t know enough to
rule out any kind of chromosomal changes. We need to look at all
chromosomes.\
Prenatal diagnosis test includes ultrasound examination, chorionic
villus sampling (CVS), amniocentesis, and cordocentesis.

In Denmark, the choice and risk of the prenatal diagnosis test must be
explained clearly to the patient to allow the patient to consider the
best option for her. Increase emphasis on quality assurance and control
of professional services, including information is very important.

Ultrasound Examination
----------------------

Ultrasound is the use of high frequency sound waves to make an image.
Ultrasound is part of prenatal diagnostic test that are used to see if
the baby actually has a particular problem. An ultrasound scan can be
conducted at any time during pregnancy. But different timing when the
ultrasound is performed serves a different purpose. The optimal time for
dating the pregnancy and determine the number of babies is between 8 and
12 weeks. The best time for baby physical development assessment to
check any abnormalities is between 18 and 20 weeks.

Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)
-------------------------------

Only women at high risk are offered CVS.Chorion is one of the membrane
that exist during pregnancy. The chorionic tissue has small projection
on its surface called villi (singular: villus) in order to give a
maximum blood. The cells of chorion are mostly the same as the cells of
the baby, because both cells are arise from the same fertilized cells.

Basically, there is two type of CVS: abdominal and vaginal CVS. In
abdominal CVS, the chorion sample is obtained using a fine needle
through the abdominal wall. In vaginal CVS, a speculum is inserted into
vagina to achieve clear view of the cervix. Then a fine tube is inserted
into uterus through the cervix to take a small sample of the chorion.
Both abdominal and vaginal CVS are performed with guidance of
ultrasound.

Amniocentesis
-------------

![Amniocentesis process](Amniocentesis.jpg "Amniocentesis process")

Amniotic fluid obtained via amniocentesis provides a source of fetal
material used in prenatal diagnosis. Amniocentesis usually performed
during 15 to 18 weeks of gestation. The reason is that 15 to 18 weeks of
gestation is consider late enough to cause no harm to the fetus
development and early enough to allow termination of pregnancy. Other
than that, optimal amount of fetal cell needed for further chromosomal
analysis can be obtain during that time of gestation. The fetus starts
to shed cells into the amniotic fluid at 11 weeks of gestation.
Ultrasound is performed before and during the amniocentesis to guide the
needle. The very thin needle is put into uterus through the abdomen.

Even though amniocentesis is considered safe and has been performed
multiple times, there is about 1% risk of abortion and it is not offered
to every pregnancy. Generally, amniocentesis is offered to couples
thought to be at increased risk of chromosomal abnormality or inherited
genetic disorder.\

Up to 20 mL of amniotic fluid is obtained from typical amniocentesis
procedure. The fluid consists of cellular component and supernatant
component which can be separated using centrifuge. The cellular
component is further analyses using biochemical, DNA testing and
chromosomal testing method. The supernatant component can be used for
certain biochemical studies mostly for determination of
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level as a screen for neural tube defect.
