The separation of the analytes takes place due to differences in the
interactions with the stationary and mobile phase. The analystes also
need to be eluted to reach the end of the column, where it will be
detected by the detector. This is the purpose of the mobile phase, to
transport the compounds from the injection point to the detector.

Mobile phases consist of a mixture of water and an organic solvent or
mixtures of organic solvents. If pH needs to be adjusted, buffer
solutions are used instead. This is important when the analytes are
sensitive to changes in pH.

The solvents are placed in the mobile phase reservoirs (see Figure 1),
which consist of a bottle with a special cap with holes. A tube is
placed in these holes connecting the mobile phase reservoir to the
column. The mobile phase will travel through these tubes (see Figure 2),
into the column and then out to the waste reservoir.

Techniques:
-----------

There are two types of technique based on the composition of the mobile
phase during the experiment.

-   **Isocratic mode**: The composition of the mobile phase stays
    constant during the run time.
-   **Gradient elution**: The composition of the mobile phase changes
    with time.

Mobile phases most commonly used
--------------------------------

Different mobile phases are used depending of the working method:

-   **Normal-phase HPLC** (polar stationary phase): Non polar solvents
    are used. The most common ones are hexane, heptane or iso-octane are
    can be combined with slightly polar solvents, such as isopropanol,
    ethyl acetate or chloroform.
-   **Reverse-phase HPLC** (non polar stationary phase): Polar solvents
    are used. Normally, water is used as a base solvent and is combined
    with a polar organic solvent (such as methanol or acetonitrile).

Similar to the stationary phase, mobile phase polarity is also a scale
(see Figure 3). Water is an example of a polar mobile phase and on the
opposite end is Hexane which is a non polar mobile phase.
