The area where substrates and co-factors binds to the enzyme is called
the active site. This is where the catalysis takes place. An active site
often appears like a pocket, and consists of several amino acids which
can have specific interactions with the substrate [1]. Fig. 1 shows the
active site of [alcohol dehydrogenase](/wiki/ADH "wikilink") where NAD^+^
binds. Amino acid residue 47, which is responsible for the Asian glow
syndrome is located in this active site, and this amino acid is
important in binding to NAD^+^. If a mutation causes an amino acid
substitution on this residue, the kinetic parameters may therefore be
altered, which is the case in the Asian glow syndrome.
