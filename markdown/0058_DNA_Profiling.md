### Unique DNA profiles

DNA profiling is a way of analyzing differences among individuals on the
DNA level. This method is also called DNA fingerprinting, because
similar to having unique fingerprints, we also have unique DNA profiles.
Large amounts of our DNA are the same in every person. But some regions,
called DNA satellites, consist of long stretches of small repeated
sequences. The number of repeats in any of these sequences differs among
individuals due to mutations accumulated through generations.

### Visualizing DNA Profiles

To identify the DNA profile of an individual, we must look at the DNA in
these particular regions. This is conducted by amplification using [PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)](/wiki/PCR "wikilink")
and [Gel Electrophoresis](/wiki/Gel_Electrophoresis "wikilink"). PCR can
amplify only the specific repeat regions by using specific primers. To
perform DNA profiling, purified DNA is required. DNA can be isolated
from most human cells.

### Reducing risk of identical profiles by using 13 PCR primer sets

There is a chance that two individuals will share the same number of
repeats at a repeated site. If we were to use only one primer set
(amplify only one repeated region), the risk that an innocent individual
shares the same number of repeats with the actual murderer would be too
great. Therefore, a minimum of 13 tandem repeat sites are investigated
while performing DNA profiling.
