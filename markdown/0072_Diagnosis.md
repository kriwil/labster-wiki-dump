Prenatal diagnosis is the process of ruling in or out fetal anomalies or
genetic disorders, to provide expecting parents with information and the
opportunity to modify pregnancy management and/or postnatal care.

After the diagnosis of cleft lip and/or palate, it is important to
consult a team of expertise to discuss and determine the best treatment
plan. The team of expertise includes including a plastic surgeon, speech
therapist, dentist, orthodontist, otolaryngologist, audiologist,
geneticist, pediatrician and feeding specialist.

There are currently no treatment for unborn babies with cleft. If the
parent decided to proceed the pregnancies, certain post delivery care
issue must be discussed which includes:\
\*Feeding (breast and bottle) assessment

-   Hearing and ear infection
-   Dental concern
-   May have missing or abnormally shaped baby and permanent teeth
-   May have uneven jaw growth
-   Type and time the surgery needed
-   The implication of the cleft for the child’s speech and dentition
-   Emotional impact on the baby and the whole family

Approximately 10-15% of individuals with cleft lip with or without cleft
palate also have a related syndrome. Most of these syndrome include
other physical problem. The

Pregnant women are well informed by the clinical geneticist; therefore
they have the access to the diagnosis of serious fetal anomalies and
therefore access to termination of pregnancy or abortion option. There
is law and ethical issues that needs to be considered before abortion is
