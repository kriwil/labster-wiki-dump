![Gene structure]( Gene structure.png "fig:Gene structure") Plants
produce numerous secondary metabolites that hold tremendous potential
for various applications such as pharmaceuticals, flavors, dyes,
fragrances and insecticides. However, the plant’s secondary metabolism
remains poorly characterized. In order to take advantage of nature's
biosynthetic machinery, knowledge of the enzymatic pathways and the
underlying genetic maps are essential. The emergence of Next Generation
Sequencing (NGS) made it possible to affordably sequence millions of DNA
sequences. Therefore, the amount of bioinformatics data is growing
exponentially. Functional genomics uses this vast amount of data to
investigate the function of genes at the genomic, transcriptomic and
proteomic level. In this lab, we will use functional genomics techniques
to characterize the enzymatic pathway of a terpenoid, which has the
potential to be used as an antimalarial drug.\

Each codon (nucleotide triplet) encodes for an amino
acid.]( genetic_code.png "fig:Genetic code Each codon (nucleotide triplet) encodes for an amino acid.")

**Transcription**\
Each enzyme consists of one or several amino acid chains that fold into
the three dimensional structure of a protein. Each amino acid is encoded
by three nucleotides of the corresponding gene sequence. The genes are
stretches of DNA molecules contained within the cell nucleus. A complex
network of signaling molecules and transcription factors regulates gene
transcription in each cell. When protein complexes bind to the promoter
sequence it triggers the transcription of the DNA code into a
complementary RNA sequence.\

**RNA Processing**\
Once transcribed, the single-stranded RNA molecule folds back on itself
and is further processed by enzyme complexes. RNA molecules perform
multiple vital roles. Only about 3% of total plant RNAs encode for
proteins. These so called messenger RNAs are processed by the
spliceosome, which splices out certain portions of the RNA. These
spliced fragments are called introns whereas the remaining protein
coding sequence consists of the exons. Introns could be considered
unimportant, junk sequences; however, they are also responsible for
alternative splicing patterns, which leads to different proteins being
derived from a single gene. Some introns are also processed to become
functional, non-coding RNAs.\
Multiple adenine residues are added to the 3' end and methylated guanine
are added to the 5' end. The remaining stretch of exons with the
flanking un-translated regions (UTR), the mature mRNA, is exported out
of the nucleus.\

**Translation**\
Upon the recruitment to a ribosome, the mRNA is translated into the
amino acid sequence. Translation is initiated at the start codon, which
marks the beginning of the exon sequence and determines the reading
frame for the translation. Following the start codon,
Adenosine-Uracil-Guanine (AUG), each nucleotide triplet is translated
into an amino acid until a stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) terminates the
translation. The newly synthesized peptide chain folds back on itself
and forms the three dimensional structure of the enzyme.\

=== Transcriptomics === Protein sequencing is much more difficult than
DNA sequencing. Therefore, the protein sequences are usually obtained
from the oligonucleotide sequence that encodes the proteins. To study
the enzymes in a certain cell population it is not necessary to sequence
the whole genome of the organism. The transcriptome is the set of all
transcribed RNA molecules in one, or a population of, cells. Because the
transcriptome only comprises a tiny fraction of the genome,
transcriptome sequencing is much faster and only intrinsically sequences
the transcribed genes. In addition, the transcriptomic data provides
information about the quantity of gene expression, which can be used to
analyze differential gene expression. In a living cell there is a
constant turnover of RNA and gene expression is continuously adjusted.
The instability of RNA molecules makes it necessary to reverse
transcribe the RNA into DNA for sequencing.
