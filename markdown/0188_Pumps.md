Pumps in the HPLC machine creates the driving force of the mobile phase
and the analytes through the column. The pump is also responsible of
generating the high pressure and a constant flow in the system. HPLC
machines are adapted to be able to handle high pressure, however it is
important that the pressure in the system is not too high because it may
damage the column. Normally the pressure inside the column (also called
backpressure) is between 2,000 to 5,000 psi.

Types of pumps
--------------

Three common types of pumps are constant pressure pumps, syringe type
pumps and reciprocating piston pumps. ![**Figure 1.** Constant pressure
pump.]( Constant pressure pump.png "fig:Figure 1. Constant pressure pump.")

-   **Constant Pressure Pumps:** As the name suggests, they provide
    constant flow rate in the column thanks to a constant pressure. They
    use the low pressure of a gas contained in a cylinder to create the
    desired high pressure of the mobile phase.

-   **Syringe Type Pumps:** They use a motorized syringe to get a
    constant solvent delivery. Changing the voltage of the motor,
    different flow rates can be obtained.

 ![**Figure 3.** Reciprocating piston
pump.]( reciprocating pump.png "fig:Figure 3. Reciprocating piston pump.")

-   **Reciprocating Piston Pumps:** They consist of a hydraulic chamber
    were a reciprocating piston is placed. This way, solvent gets in the
    pump when the piston moves back and is pushed into the column when
    the piston moves forward.
