Bioreactor is a mechanical microorganism and substrate vessel where
biological conversion occurs in a controllable manner. The substrate
will be biochemically processed by the microorganism, and the
biochemical product can be harnessed. Sometimes, the word fermenter is
used instead of bioreactor; however, both mean the same.

inlet, 5. nutrient inlet, 6. stirrer and 7. culture inlet

The key for an effective bioreactor is to control and maintain the
microbial growth and metabolite production inside the bioreactor. To
achieve sustainable microbial growth and metabolite production, certain
parameters must be controlled. Those parameters are as follows:

-   Sterilization of media and vessel
-   Sufficient substrate and growth factors (e.g., vitamins) in media.
-   Agitation (stirring)
-   Temperature control
-   pH control
-   Anti-foaming (During the fermentation foam is formed, which can
    disrupt the measuring equipment)
-   Control overflow (used when media are added continuously)
-   Aeration (oxygen supply for aerobic processes).

One of the worst things that can happen during fermentation experiments
is to detect contaminants. Contaminants are unwanted microorganisms that
compete with the original strain over nutrients, and disrupt the
experiment. Contaminants can be detected microscopically, or from the
dataset. A contaminant will often grow rapidly, thereby giving rise to
very high CO~2~-levels, and a high biomass concentration relative to the
product. It is extremely important to prevent contamination; therefore,
the fermenter must be sterilized.
