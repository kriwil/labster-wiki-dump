DNA polymerase is the enzyme that is responsible for the formation of a DNA strand from a template DNA strand. For the DNA polymerase to initiate the formation of a new DNA strand, it needs a short "starter" strand, called a [[Primers|Primer]]. The primer must be bound to an area of the template DNA to which it is complementary. 


===Synthesis of a new DNA strand===
DNA polymerase can add nucleotides to the 3' end of a primer bound to the template DNA because this end has a free hydroxyl group (-OH) that can react with the phosphate group of the incoming nucleotide. Therefore, the new DNA strand is said to be synthesized in the 5'&rarr;3' direction. The new DNA strand will be complementary to the template strand, and antiparallel.


===The making of a thermostable DNA polymerase (Taq) for [[PCR]]===
DNA polymerase originates from living organisms and is most functional at physiological conditions. Hence, the DNA polymerase from most organisms would not work well in a PCR reaction because most polymerases degrade at 90<sup>o</sup>C. If such a polymerase was to be used for PCR, it would be necessary to add new DNA polymerase after each cycle. Luckily, a suitable DNA polymerase was discovered by Thomas Brock: the Taq polymerase. This DNA polymerase was isolated from the bacterium ''Thermus aquaticus'' found in the hot springs at Yellowstone National Park. The Taq polymerase is active at temperatures up to 95<sup>o</sup>C. This ensures that multiple cycles of PCR can be performed in a single continuous event, and no additional polymerase is required.
