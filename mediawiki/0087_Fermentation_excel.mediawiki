=== Plotting the data=== 
'''Step 1.''' Now you have your data you should show them in a graph. Chose "Insert" and select "scatter", see picture 1.
Chose "select data" in the top, and click "add", see picture 2. <br>

'''Step 2.'''
Now chose the time as the x-coordinates(the green arrow on picture 3), and biomass and the y-coordinate(the red arrow). Give the series name "Biomass". Click Ok.  <br>

'''Step 3.'''
Great job. Repeat this for all the data.<br>

<!--Necessary empty space end: -->
'''Step 4.'''
When you have done this you should alter O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. Right click on the plots of O<sub>2</sub>, see picture 4. 
Then chose "Format dataseries". A pop-up menu appears, see picture 5. Click "Secondary axis", under "plot on".
Do the same thing for CO<sub>2</sub>.<br>

'''Step 5.'''
Finally you can add the units for the axis, using the "layout-options", see picture 6.<br>
Good job. It looks very good!

=== Regression analysis=== 
You will need to perform an regression analysis, for instance to find the specific growth rate.
This is quite easy. 
First lets make the data. Click on a new column, next to the data. Press. "=ln()". Within the parenthesis add the coordinate for the first biomass datapoint. For instance:  "=ln(B2)", see picture 7. <br>
Next you can click in the bottom of that cell, and drag the command, to transform all the biomass data, see picture 8. 
This way you have calculated ln(biomass) very quickly. <br>

<!--Necessary empty space end: -->
The next thing to do is make a plot of ln(biomass) over time. Repeat the procedure of plotting data. <br>
When you have done this you simply right click on a datapoint in the plots, and chose "add trendline", see picture 9.
A pop-up menu appears. Add the linear regression, and remember to click "show equation in plot".
You should now have something that looks like picture 10. <br>
You are now a master in excel. Great job!.
