As explained in the [[End-repair]] section, the purpose of adding Adenine at the end of the DNA strand is to allow specific paring with the Thymine tail of the adapter. 


The adapter is a double strand DNA that are complementary to each other. One strand having a T-tail at the 3' end (<span style="color:#0000FF">blue strand</span>), and the other strand is complimentary to the first strand (<span style="color:#FF8C00">orange strand</span>). Because Adenine pairs up specifically with Thymine, we can be sure that 1 end of the DNA sample will have the <span style="color:#0000FF">blue adapter</span> whereas the other end will have the <span style="color:#FF8C00">orange adapter</span>.


==Functions of adapters==
The adapters have important functions in Next Generation Sequencing.
* '''Primers'''

The adapters also serve as universal primer-docking site. It is not possible to individually design primers that match a specific DNA molecule to be able to amplify our whole genome! The adapters provide a cap for all different DNA strands, so that we only need to use 2 sets of primers and be able to amplify all the different small DNA molecules. 

* '''Flow cell docker'''

The adapters also help these DNA molecules to dock/attach to the flow cell. The flow cell is covered in many short DNA molecules that are complimentary to the adapter. When our DNA molecules are pumped into the flow cell, the adapters will recognize the short DNA molecules attached to the flow cell and bind together. This is important for the [[Cluster generation]] to take place.
