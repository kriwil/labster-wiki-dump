Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or citric acid cycle is the pathway where pyruvate is converted to CO<sub>2</sub> and intermediates are used for oxidative phosphorylation. Before pyruvate that has been generated can enter the Krebs cycle, pyruvate is first decarboxylated, leading to the production of CO<sub>2</sub>, NADH, and the energy rich acetyl-CoA.  The cycle begins with the combination of the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA with the four-carbon compound oxaloacetate to form a six-carbon citric acid compound. During the cycle, two additional CO<sub>2</sub> molecules, more NADH, and one FADH are formed. In the end, oxaloacetate is regenerated to return as an acetyl acceptor, and the cycle is completed.
