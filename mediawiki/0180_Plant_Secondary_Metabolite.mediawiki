Beside primary metabolites, which are essential for plant growth, in addition plants also produce various secondary metabolites which are important for the plants to adjust to their environment. Primary metabolites include amino acids, nucleotides, sugars and lipids. Secondary metabolites are very diverse and often unique to a few closely related species. Depending on the precursor derived from the primary metabolism, secondary metabolites are divided into three groups:
<br>
•	Terpenes and Terpenoids<br>
•	Phenolic and polyphenolic compounds<br>
•	Nitrogen/sulphur containing compounds <br>

Secondary metabolites fulfill many different functions such as protection from herbivores and microbial pathogens or attractants for pollinators. Many secondary metabolites are important as industrial materials, flavors, coloring, poisons and medicinal drugs.  <br>

===Terpenes and Terpenoids===
Terpenoids, or isoprenoids, are the largest group of natural compounds. Terpenoids consist of a highly non-polar terpene backbone with functional groups attached to it. Therefore terpenoids are mostly insoluble in water. As plant plant defense molecules, many terpenoids are biologically active. Therefore terpenoids can be used for treating human diseases. Well-known terpenoids include menthol, cannabinoids, citral and the curcuminoids found in turmeric and mustard seed. Most terpenes are associated with distinct flavors.

Artemisinin, produced by ''Artemisinin annua'', is a sesquiterpenoid antimalarial theraputic. When the malaria parasite invades a red blood cell and digests the hemoglobin it causes oxidative stress. This initiates a chemical reaction of arthemisinin which becomes highly reactive and perturbs the redox homeostasis in the parasite. The precise mechanism of action is still unknown.

===Phenolics===
Phenolic compounds contain a phenol group. One of the largest classes of phenolic compounds are the flavonoids. The yellow pigmentation of citrus fruits is derived from flavonoids. They are also contained in berries, dark chocolate and red wine. Flavonoids have important anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and anti-cancer activities due to their powerful anti-oxidant properties. 

===Nitrogen-Containing Compounds===
Nitrogen-containing compounds are diverse plant secondary metabolites that contain nitrogen in their structure. This class include alkaloids and cyanogenic glycosides which are famous for their toxicity and medicinal properties. Alkaloids acts as defence molecules against herbivores, especially mammals. Cyanogenic glycosides are known for their capabilities to release volatile poisonous hydrogen cyanide (HCN).
