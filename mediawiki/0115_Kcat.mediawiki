The catalytic constant (k<sub>cat</sub>) or turnover number is the number of enzymatic reactions a single saturated enzyme molecule can catalyze per unit of time, usually expressed in s<sup>-1</sup>. k<sub>cat</sub> is not dependent on the concentration of the enzyme, and is therefore a better parameter than [[vmax|V<sub>max</sub>]] for comparing different enzymes. Because k<sub>cat</sub> is the maximum number of chemical reactions a single enzyme molecule can catalyze, the maximum velocity (V<sub>max</sub>) at a specific enzyme concentration is obtained by multiplying k<sub>cat</sub> with the concentration of the enzyme ([E]), i.e., V<sub>max</sub> = k<sub>cat</sub> &bull; [E]. This means, that if V<sub>max</sub> and [E], which can be experimentally measured, are known, k<sub>cat</sub> can be calculated as follows [1].
