In accordance with the [[Michaelis-Menten|Michaelis-Menten equation]], the initial reaction rate (V<sub>0</sub>) increases at increased substrate concentrations [S]. The reaction rate increases more at lower substrate concentrations, and it eventually reaches a plateau, approaching the maximum velocity V<sub>max</sub> (Fig. 1). The maximum initial velocity is reached when the enzyme is saturated, i.e., when enough substrate is present to ensure that practically all the enzyme is part of the enzyme-substrate complex. Because the enzyme can never be completely saturated, V<sub>max</sub> is never fully reached. V<sub>max</sub> is dependent on 2 things: the [[kcat|turnover number]] of the enzyme (k<sub>cat</sub>), and the concentration of the enzyme [E] [1].


Vmax = [E] &bull; kcat

Thus, a higher [E] leads to a higher V<sub>max</sub>. The turnover number will be described in more detail on the following page. 


==Determining V<sub>max</sub>==
Just like [[km|k<sub>m</sub>]], V<sub>max</sub> can be determined using the Lineweaver-Burk equation (Fig. 2):

Based on this equation, a straight line fitted to a double-reciprocal plot will have the y-intercept 1/V<sub>max</sub>, and V<sub>max</sub> can therefore be obtained by taking the reciprocal to this intercept [1].
