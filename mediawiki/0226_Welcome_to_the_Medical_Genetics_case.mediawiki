Welcome to the Medical Genetics case!


In this case, you will learn about cancer genetics, in particular, hereditary breast cancer. You will learn about hereditary cancer, how to perform linkage analysis to identify the defected gene, and how to perform PCR, gel electrophoresis, the protein truncation test, and DNA sequencing to confirm a mutation. You will also learn about cancer development and the role of BRCA genes in breast cancer


You will be able to find all the related theory required to complete the case from this wiki page. 

Good luck!
