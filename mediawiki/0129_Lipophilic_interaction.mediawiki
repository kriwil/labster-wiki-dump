As written in the previous section [[High Performance Liquid Chromatography]], the separation takes place in the column due to interactions between the analyte and the stationary and mobile phases. 

There is an equilibrium between the analyte in the two phases. The more the analyte interacts with the stationary phase, the more it will stay in the column. If it interacts more with the mobile phase, it will stay less time in the column.
The partition coefficient (''K'') is used to relate the concentration of the analyte in each of the two phases, as shown below:

Where ''K'' is the Partition coefficient, ''C<sub>A</sub><sup>stationary phase</sup>'' is the molar concentration of analyte in the stationary phase and ''C<sub>A</sub><sup>mobile phase</sup>'' is the molar concentration of the analyte in the mobile phase. The longer an analyte spends time in the stationary phase, the larger the ''K'' value is.


== London dispersion force == 
[[File: London Dispension Force.jpg|frame|x300px|London Dispersion force is a weak interaction that occurs between non polar molecules.]]

There are different types of interactions occurring between the side chains of the beads of the column and the analytes in the sample. One of those interactions is the so called London dispersion force. This is a weak interaction that occurs between two molecules that are non polar, that is, two lipophilic molecules. This force is present between two instantaneously induced dipoles, which are due to the movement of electrons in the molecules. 
If the stationary phase has non polar chains attached to the inert support (for example the C-18 chain seen in the figure), analytes with non polar groups (for example Magnesium Stearate seen in the figure) will present London dispersion forces and stay longer in the column.
