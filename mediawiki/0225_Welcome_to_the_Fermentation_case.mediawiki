Welcome to the fermentation case!


In this case, you will learn about the fermentation technique. You will start a fermentation batch, check for contaminants, calculate the specific growth rate and yield coefficients, optimize the growth condition, set up the stoichiometric equation and calculate the carbon balance.


You will be able to find all the related theory to complete the case from this Wiki page.


Good luck! 



== Fermentation case progression ==
* Introductory (bioethanol plant)
* Mission 1: Preparing yeast inoculum
* Mission 2: Checking for contaminants
* Mission 3: The first batch of fermentation
* Mission 4: Optimizing growth rate
* Mission 5: Anaerobic fermentation
* End of the case

==Fermentation (High School) progression ==
* Introductory (bioethanol plant)
* Mission 1: Inoculum preparation
* Mission 2: Yeast growth phase qualitative assessment
* Mission 3: Yeast growth phase quantitaive assessment
* End of the case
