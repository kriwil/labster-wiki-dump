===Malaria parasite===
Malaria is an infectious disease caused by a protozoan from the genus ''Plasmodium''. Malaria parasites have a complex life cycle with vertebrates, such as humans, as the secondary host and the female ''Anopheles'' mosquito as the definitive host. An infected mosquito injects the parasite, via the salivary glands, into the blood stream of the subject; the parasite then migrates to the liver where it infects the red blood cells. The parasite reproduces asexually and feeds on the hemoglobin. A subsequent bite by another mosquito closes the parasite's life cycle. The four major parasite species responsible for causing malaria are ''Plasmodium falciparum'', ''Plasmodium malariae'', ''Plasmodium ovale'', and ''Plasmodium vivax''. Fatal cases are usually caused by ''Plasmodium falciparum''. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), half of the worldâ€™s population is at risk of malaria and around one million deaths are caused annually.

===Antimalarial Drugs===
Malaria can be treated by several drugs such as quinine, chloroquine, mefloquine and artemisinins. Although there are cures for malaria, the drugs are often too expensive for the people who are in need most. Another major threat to humans are parasite strains which are resistant to antimalarial drugs. All of the antimalarial drugs have reported instances of resistance except for artemisinins. However, in the last few years a parasite strain with partial resistance to artemisinins emerged in Southeast Asia. Therefore, the development of novel drugs is essential to fight the disease.
