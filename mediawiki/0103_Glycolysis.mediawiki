Glycolysis or the Embden-Meyerhof pathway is a metabolic pathway to begin the break down of glucose. This pathway is used by most autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms, both aerobes and anaerobes. Glycolysis does not require oxygen; however, it can occur in the absence or presence of oxygen.
Glycolysis consists of four important steps:
*Glucose phosphorylation
*Breakdown of six-carbon molecule (glucose) into three- carbon molecule
*Transfer of two electrons to coenzyme NAD
*Energy capturing in ATP
The end products of glycolysis are two ATP molecules, two pyruvic acids, and two molecule of NADH.
