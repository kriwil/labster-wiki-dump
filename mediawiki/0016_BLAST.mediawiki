BLAST is the abbreviation for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. It can be accessed via the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnological Information) website. BLAST is one of the most widely used bioinformatics tools because it helps researchers efficiently compare a query oligonucleotide or protein sequence to large databases. Genes that share the highest homology with the input sequence are identified, and thereby, the biological function of the query gene is deduced.

BLAST uses statistics to sort the sequence database and thus, identify the best matches. The user receives the following output: Max score, Total Score, Query Coverage, E-value, and Maximum Identity. The E-value or expected value represents the number of hits you expect to find in a database of the same size. Low E-values indicate a significant result. The Maximum Identity represents the percentage of the shared identities between the query and the hit in a nucleotide-to-nucleotide alignment. The alignment scores are numerical values that describe the overall quality of an alignment. The percentage of the query length that is included in the aligned segments is called the query coverage.
