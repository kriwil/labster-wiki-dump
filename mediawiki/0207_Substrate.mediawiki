A substrate is a molecule upon which an enzyme acts. If we think of the enzyme as a machine in an assembly line, the substrate would be what we put into the machine to get the output we want.


The substrate for [[ADH|alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADH), the enzyme we are working with in this case, is ethanol; however, ADH can also bind other substrates with a similar structure such as methanol. Similar to the way ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde, methanol is converted to formaldehyde by ADH. Formaldehyde is a very toxic compound; smaller amounts of methanol may lead to blindness, while larger amounts are lethal [1].
Thus, alcohol dehydrogenase is an example of a less specific enzyme with an affinity for several substrates. Some enzymes, as we mentioned earlier, are very specific and will only catalyze 1 reaction, whereas others, such as ADH, are more flexible.


The chemical structure of ethanol can be seen on the figures to the right.
