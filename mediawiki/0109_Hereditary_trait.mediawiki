A hereditary etiology should be suspected if a phenotype appears more frequent in some breeds/families than others. This is due to the fact, that animals of the same breed/family share more alleles (including disease alleles) than others. The suspicion can be strengthened if a similar phenotype is known to be hereditary in other species. Whether it is hereditary or not can be investigated by collecting family material for a pedigree and observing the pattern of inheritance.
