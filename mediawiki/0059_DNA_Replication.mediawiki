When a cell prepares to divide, all its DNA is copied to produce two new DNA molecules. This process is known as replication and it ensures that all DNA in a cell is passed along to the daughter cells. DNA is replicated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase, which makes a copy of a DNA strand by connecting nucleotides to each other in the same sequence as in the original, template DNA.
