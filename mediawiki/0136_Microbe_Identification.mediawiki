Identification of unknown microbe species is important in various applications, such as disease diagnosis and infection treatment in the health industry, criminal investigation, environmental studies or inoculum preparation in the wine and brewing industry. Microbe identification can be performed with several methods, as follows:

===Morphology identification===
In morphology identification, gross and microscopic morphology are examined to determine the species of the microbe of interest. Gross morphology includes colony shape, size, color and surface features. Using a microscope, one can also determine the shape of the microorganisms. But the, morphology identification method exhibits some drawbacks, since it can be used only for organisms that can be cultivated ''in vitro''. <br>
*''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' <br>
Colony morphology on Sabouraud dextrose agar: cream colored and smooth. <br>
Microscopic morphology: large, globose to ellipsoidal budding yeast-like cells. <br>
*''Lactobacillus''<br>
Colony morphology:Circular form and entire margin.<br>
Microscopic morphology:Gram positive rod.<br>


===Biochemical tests===
Morphology identification has some limitations, making it less specific. Closely related organisms can be differentiated using a series of biochemical tests that identify various metabolic properties of different bacterial species. Biochemical tests that have been used to identify bacteria as follows:

===Molecular Methods===
The classical methods of microbe identification are relatively laborious. Identification using the molecular method has greatly improved the speed and specificity of the identification process. In this method, nucleic acid sequences (DNA and RNA) from unknown species and known species (from a database) are compared to determine their similarities. Basically, there are two types of identification using the molecular method:<br>
* Genotypic methods<br>
This methods involves extraction of genomic DNA from an unknown microbe species, which is further analysed with Southern blot, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP).<br>
* Protein-based methods<br>
This method includes Western blot, Immuno-precipitation and Enzyme Linked Immuno-sorbant Assay (ELISA), which use antibodies to detect specific proteins that are unique to an organism.
