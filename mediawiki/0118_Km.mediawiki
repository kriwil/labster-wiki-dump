The Michaelis constant, K<sub>m</sub>, is a parameter in the [[Michaelis-Menten|Michaelis-Menten equation]]. K<sub>m</sub> is equal to the substrate concentration where the corresponding reaction rate is ½ &bull; V<sub>max</sub> (Fig.1). An enzyme with a low K<sub>m</sub> therefore achieves its [[vmax|half-maximal velocity]] at a low substrate concentration, while an enzyme with a high K<sub>m</sub> needs high substrate concentrations to achieve this velocity. It has been experimentally shown, that K<sub>m</sub> of an enzyme is usually close to the cellular concentration of its substrate. For an enzymatic reaction involving 2 steps, where the second step is rate limiting, K<sub>m</sub> is approximately equal to the dissociation constant of the ES complex. In this case, a low K<sub>m</sub> implies a high affinity for the substrate; however this interpretation of K<sub>m</sub> is only valid for a few enzymes [1].


==The Lineweaver-Burk equation==
Several methods for determining Km exist. The most direct method is to plot V<sub>0</sub> against [S] and use curve fitting software to fit the Michaelis-Menten equation directly. However, certain transformations allow determination via linear regression, and these transformations are also useful when analyzing enzyme inhibition. Several transformations are possible; however, a simple one is obtained by taking the reciprocal on both sides of the Michaelis-Menten equation. This leads to the following expression, called the Lineweaver-Burk equation:

This equation shows, that a plot of 1/V<sub>0</sub> against 1/[S] should give a plot that can be fitted by a straight line with the y-intercept 1/V<sub>max</sub> and slope K<sub>m</sub>/V<sub>max</sub>. Thus, K<sub>m</sub> can be obtained using linear regression. Fig. 2. shows an illustration of how to interpret the slope and intersects on a Lineweaver-Burk plot. [1]

==Other transformations==
Notable, the Lineweaver-Burk transformation is not the only option. For example, a plot of [S]/V<sub>0</sub> against [S] (a Hanes–Woolf plot) will also result in a straight line [2]. However, in this case, we will use the Lineweaver-Burk transformation:
