Labster is a virtual laboratory where you can perform advanced biotechnology experiments on your computer. Below is a quick guide of the most important elements.


===Registration===
You can either register by using a registration link (that is shared by your teacher) or by clicking on the link sent through your email. Please check on your spam folder if your teacher has sent you the invitation email and you have not received it.

All the virtual labs you have access to are shown on the left menu. You can select the virtual lab you would like access to simply by clicking on it, for example now we are looking at the dashboard for the Demo Lab. In this window, you are able to see your progress including your scores, all the quiz questions that you have answered and also the five highest scoring students in your course.
 
Click on the green “Play” button in order to start the virtual labs. If you have accessed it previously, there will be another button “Continue” that you can select. By selecting the “Continue” button, you will re-start at the latest saving checkpoint from your previous play.


===Technical requirements===
*'''Operating system compatibility'''
Labster virtual labs are accessible from both Mac and PC. Please note that cur- rently we do not support iPad, tablets or mobile phones. You also need internet access in order to access the virtual labs. We recommend using Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome web browser. Please make sure to update your internet browser to the latest version. 

*'''Unity plugin'''
After clicking on the “Play” button, a new tab will open with a specific web address to the virtual lab. You need to install Unity web player (which is a plugin needed to operate the virtual lab). There will be a pop-up asking you to install Unity web player if you do not have it yet. See the screenshot below:

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Follow the instruction for installing the Unity web player. Normally it takes around 10 seconds to install it. Once installed, it will run in the background; you will not see an icon of Unity on your desktop and the virtual lab will automatically load.

It may take a while to load the virtual lab, this depends on your internet and your computer speed. Please be patient, the page will eventually load.

*'''Troubleshooting'''
If you still cannot load the virtual laboratory on your internet browser, try by re-starting the computer.

If suddenly there is an error while accessing the virtual laboratory (for example: the workbenches are showing in the wrong places) try to clear the cache on your inter- net browser. Cache is a temporary memory in your browser to load the data faster. This will not interfere with your computer’s memory. You can clear the cache memory by opening the preference/setting menu on your internet browser --> privacy --> clear browsing data.
