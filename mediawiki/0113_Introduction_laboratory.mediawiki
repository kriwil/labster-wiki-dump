Welcome to Labster's Introduction Laboratory!


In the Introduction Laboratory you will learn about safety in the laboratory, measuring pH, understand diffusion and osmosis and then perform blood typing test. 


You will be able to find all the related theory needed to complete the case from this Wiki page.


Good luck!
